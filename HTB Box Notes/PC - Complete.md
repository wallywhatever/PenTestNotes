there is something running on port 8000 that is not exposed
using
```
ssh -L 1234:localhost:8000 sau@10.10.11.214
```
we can set up a port forward to access it and it gives a login page for something called pyload
there is an unauthenticated RCE [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51532) that we can use to execute a reverse shell and get root
