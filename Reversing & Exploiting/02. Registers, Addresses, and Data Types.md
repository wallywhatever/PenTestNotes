# Registers

- **Data Registers**
	- Usually used for storing instructions/syscall arguments.
	- Primary data registers: **rax, rbx, rcx, rdx**
	- **rdi, rsi** are usually used for `destination` and `source` operands
	- **r8, r9, r10** are secondary data registers

- **Pointer Registers**
	- Used to store specific important address pointers
		- **rbp** - Base Stack Pointer, points to the beginning of the stack
		- **rsp** - Current Stack Pointer, points to the current location in the stack (top of the stack)
		- **rip** - Instruction Pointer, points to the next instruction

### Sub-Registers
- Each 64-bit register can be divided into sub-registers containing the lower bits.

The following are the names of the sub-registers for all of the essential registers in an x86_64 architecture:

# Memory Addresses

- RAM is segmented into various regions, like the Stack, the heap, and other program and kernel-specific regions
- Each memory region has  `read`, `write`, `execute` permissions

- In the Instruction Cycle, the first step is to fetch the instruction from the address it's located at
- There are several types of fetching (addressing modes) in x86:

- The less immediate a value is, the slower it is to fetch.

# Address Endianness

- **Little Endian**
	- Right-to-Left
- **Big Endian**
	- Left-to-Right

Little Endian processors would store `0x0011223344556677` as `0x7766554433221100`

> Little-endian is used with Intel/AMD x86. 

The important thing we need to take from this is knowing that our bytes are stored into memory from right-to-left. So, if we were to push an address or a string with Assembly, we would have to push it in reverse. For example, if we want to store the word `Hello`, we would push its bytes in reverse: `o`, `l`, `l`, `e`, and finally `H`.

# Data Types

These are the most common data types for instructions

>Whenever we use a variable with a certain data type or use a data type with an instruction, both operands should be of the same size. For example, we can't use a variable defined as `byte` with `rax`, as `rax` has a size of 8 bytes.

The following table shows the appropriate data type for each sub-register:
