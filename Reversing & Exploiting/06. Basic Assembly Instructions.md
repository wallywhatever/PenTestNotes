# Data Movement

The main Data Movement instructions are:

- `mov` - Move data or load immediate data
	- `mov rax, 1` -> `rax = 1`
- `lea` - Load an address pointing to the value
	- `lea rax, [rsp+5]` -> `rax = rsp+5`
- `xchg` - Swap data between to registers or adresses
	- `xchg rax, rbx` -> `rax = rbx, rbx = rax`

## Moving Data

Let's use the `mov` instruction as the very first instructions in our module project `fibonacci`. We will need to load the initial values (`F0=0` and `F1=1`) to `rax` and `rbx`, such that `rax = 0` and `rbx = 1`. Let us copy the following code to a `fib.s` file:
```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    mov rax, 0
    mov rbx, 1
```
Now, let's assemble this code and run it with `gdb` to see how the `mov` instruction works in action:
![[2023-07-10 15_47_19-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

Like this, we have loaded the initial values into our registers to later perform other operations and instructions on them.

>Note: In assembly, moving data does not affect the source operand. So, we can consider `mov` as a `copy` function, rather than an actual move.\


## Loading Data

We can load immediate data using the `mov` instruction. For example, we can load the value of `1` into the `rax` register using the `mov rax, 1` instruction. We have to remember here that `the size of the loaded data depends on the size of the destination register`. For example, in the above `mov rax, 1` instruction, since we used the 64-bit register `rax`, it will be moving a 64-bit representation of the number `1` (i.e. `0x00000001`), which is not very efficient.

`This is why it is more efficient to use a register size that matches our data size`. For example, we will get the same result as the above example if we use `mov al, 1`, since we are moving 1-byte (`0x01`) into a 1-byte register (`al`), which is much more efficient. This is evident when we look at the disassembly of both instructions in `objdump`.

Let us take the following basic assembly code to compare the disassembly of both instructions:
```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    mov rax, 0
	mov rbx, 1
    mov bl, 1
```

Now let's assemble it and view its shellcode with `objdump`:
```shell-session
wallywhatever@htb[/htb]$ nasm -f elf64 fib.s && objdump -M intel -d fib.o
...SNIP...
0000000000000000 <_start>:
   0:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    eax,0x0
   5:	bb 01 00 00 00       	mov    ebx,0x1
   a:	b3 01                	mov    bl,0x1
```

The shellcode of the first instruction is more than double the size of the last instruction.

>Understanding this will become very handy when writing shellcodes.

Let's modify our code to use sub-registers to make it more efficient:
```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    mov al, 0
    mov bl, 1
```

The `xchg` instruction will swap the data between the two registers. Try adding `xchg rax, rbx` to the end of the code, assemble it, and then run it through `gdb` to see how it works.


## Address Pointers

In many cases, we would see that the register or address we are using does not immediately contain the final value but contains another address that points to the final value. This is always the case with _pointer_ registers, like `rsp`, `rbp`, and `rip`, but is also used with any other register or memory address.

For example, let's assemble and run `gdb` on our assembled `fib` binary, and check the `rsp` and `rip` registers:
![[2023-07-10 15_52_06-Hack The Box - Academy.png|500]]

We see that both registers contain pointer addresses to other locations. `GEF` does an excellent job of showing us the final destination value.


#### Moving Pointer Values

We can see that the `rsp` register holds the final value of `0x1`, and its immediate value is a pointer address to `0x1`. So, if we were to use `mov rax, rsp`, we won't be moving the value `0x1` to `rax`, but we will be moving the pointer address `0x00007fffffffe490` to `rax`.

>To move the actual value, we will have to use square brackets `[]`, which in `x86_64` assembly and `Intel` syntax means `load value at address`. 

So, in the same above example, if we wanted to move the final value `rsp` is pointing to, we can wrap `rsp` in square brackets, like `mov rax, [rsp]`, and this `mov` instruction will move the final value rather than the immediate value (which is an address to the final value).

>We can use square brackets to compute an address offset relative to a register or another address. For example, we can do `mov rax, [rsp+10]` to move the value stored 10 address away from `rsp`.

To properly demonstrate this, let's take the following example code:
```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    mov rax, rsp
    mov rax, [rsp]
```

Now, let's assemble the code and run the program with gdb:
![[2023-07-10 15_54_47-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

The `mov rax, rsp` moved the immediate value stored at `rsp` (which is a pointer address to `rsp`) to the `rax` register.Now let's press `si` and check how `rax` will look after the second instruction:
![[2023-07-10 15_56_09-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

This time, the final value of `0x1` was moved into the `rax` register.

>Note: When using `[]`, we may need to set the data size before the square brackets, like `byte` or `qword`. However, in most cases, `nasm` will automatically do that for us. We can see above that the final instruction is actually `mov rax, QWORD PTR [rsp]`. We also see that `nasm` also added `PTR` to specify moving a value from a pointer.


#### Loading Value Pointers

Finally, we need to understand how to load a pointer address to a value, using the `lea` (or `Load Effective Address`) instruction, which loads a pointer to the specified value, as in `lea rax, [rsp]`. This is the opposite of what we just learned above (i.e., load pointer to a value vs. move value from pointer).

In some instances, we need to load the address of a value to a certain register rather than directly load the value in that register. This is usually done when the data is large and would not fit in one register, so the data is placed on the stack or in the heap, and a pointer to its location is stored in the register.

For example, the `write` syscall we used in our `HelloWorld` program requires a pointer to the text to be printed, instead of directly providing the text, which may not fit in its entirety in the register, as the register is only 64-bits or 8 bytes.

First, if we wanted to load a direct pointer to a variable or a label, we can still use `mov` instructions. Since the variable name is a pointer to where it is located in memory, `mov` will store this pointer to the destination address. 

>For example, both `mov rax, rsp` and `lea rax, [rsp]` will do the same thing of storing the pointer to `message` at `rax`
>
>However, if we wanted to load a pointer with an offset (i.e., a few addresses away from a variable or an address), we should use `lea`. 

This is why with `lea` the source operand is usually a variable, a label, or an address wrapped in square brackets, as in `lea rax, [rsp+10]`. This enables using offsets (i.e., `[rsp+10]`).

>Note that if we use `mov rax, [rsp+10]`, it will actually move the value at `[rsp+10]` to `rax`, as discussed earlier. We cannot move a pointer with an offset using `mov`.

Let's take the following example to demonstrate how `lea` works and how it can differ from `mov`:
```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    lea rax, [rsp+10]
    mov rax, [rsp+10]
```

Now let's assemble it and run it with `gdb`:
![[2023-07-10 15_59_16-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

 `lea rax, [rsp+10]` loaded the address that is 10 addresses away from `rsp` (in other words, 10 addresses away from top of stack). Now let's `si` to see what `mov rax, [rsp+10]` would do:
 ![[2023-07-10 15_59_54-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

As expected, we see that `mov rax, [rsp+10]` moved the value stored there to `rax`.

# Arithmetic Instructions

## Unary Instructions (1 Operand)

- **inc** - Increment by 1
	- `inc rax` -> `rax++` 
	- `rax += 1` -> `rax = 2`
- **dec** - Decrement by 1
	- `dec rax` -> `rax--` 
	- `rax -= 1` -> `rax = 0`

Let's practice these instructions by going back to our `fib.s` code. So far, we have initialized `rax` and `rbx` with our initial values `0` and `1` with the `mov` instruction. Instead of moving the immediate value of `1` to `bl`, let's move `0` to it, and then use `inc` to make it `1`:
```nasm
global  _start
section .text
_start:
    mov al, 0
    mov bl, 0
    inc bl
```

As we can see, `rbx` started with the value `0`, and with `inc rbx`, it was incremented to `1`. The `dec` instruction is similar to `inc`, but decrements by `1` instead of incrementing.

`This knowledge will become very handy later on.`

## Binary Instructions (2 Operands)

For the following examples assume `rax` and `rbx` start at 1.

- **add** - Add both operands
	- `add rax, rbx` -> `rax = 1 + 1` -> `2`
- **sub** - Subtract Source from Destination (i.e. `rax = rax - rbx`)
	- `sub rax, rbx` -> `rax = 1 - 1` -> `0`
- **imul** - Multiply both operands
	- `imul rax, rbx` -> `rax = 1 * 1` -> `1`

>In all of the above instructions the result is always stored in the destination operand and does not affect the source.

So, let's add `add rax, rbx` to the end of our `fib.s` code:
```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
   mov al, 0
   mov bl, 0
   inc bl
   add rax, rbx
```

Now, let's assemble our code, and run it with `gdb`:
![[Pasted image 20230711122915.png]]

After the instruction is processed, `rax` is equal to `0x1 + 0x0`, which is `0x1`. Using the same principle, if we had other Fibonacci numbers in `rax` and `rbx`, we'd get the new Fibonacci using add.


## Bitwise Instructions

Bitwise Instructions are instructions that work on the bit level (we'll assume that `rax = 1` and `rbx = 2` for each instruction):

- **not** - Bitwise NOT (invert all bits, 0->1 and 1->0)
	- `not rax` -> `NOT 00000001` -> `11111110`
- **and** - Bitwise AND (if both bits are 1 -> 1, if bits are different -> 0)
	- `and rax, rbx` -> `00000001 AND 00000010` -> `00000000`
- **or** - Bitwise OR (if either bit is 1 -> 1, if both are 0 -> 0)|
	- `or rax, rbx` -> `00000001 OR 00000010` -> `00000011`
- **xor** - Bitwise XOR (if bits are the same -> 0, if bits are different -> 1)
	- `xor rax, rbx` -> `00000001 XOR 00000010` -> `00000011`

The instruction we will be using the most is `xor`. The `xor` instruction has various use cases, but since it zeros similar bits, we can use it to turn any value to 0 by `xor`ing a value with itself. We need to put, `using xor on any register with itself will turn it into 0`.

For example, if we want to turn the `rax` register to `0`, the most efficient way to do it is `xor rax, rax`, which will make `rax = 0`. This is simply because all bits of `rax` are similar, and so `xor` will turn all of them to `0`. Going back to our previous `fib.s` code, instead of moving `0` to both `rax` and `rbx`, we can use `xor` on each of them, as follows:

```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    xor rax, rax
    xor rbx, rbx
    inc rbx
    add rax, rbx
```

This code should perform the exact same operations, but now in a more efficient way. Let's assemble our code, and run it with `gdb`:
![[Pasted image 20230711125236.png]]

As we can see, `xor`ing our registers with themselves turned each of them to `0`'s, and the rest of the code performed the same operations as earlier, so we ended up with the same final values for both `rax` and `rbx`.
