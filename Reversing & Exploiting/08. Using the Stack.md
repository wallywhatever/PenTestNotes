The stack is a segment of memory allocated for the program to store data in, and it is usually used to store data and then retrieve them back temporarily. The top of the stack is referred to by the Top Stack Pointer `rsp`, while the bottom is referred to by the Base Stack Pointer `rbp`.

We can `push` data into the stack, and it will be at the top of the stack (i.e. `rsp`), and then we can `pop` data out of the stack into a register or a memory address, and it will be removed from the top of the stack.

- **push** - Copies the specified register/address to the top of the stack
	- `push rax`
- **pop** - Moves the item at the top of the stack to the specified register/addresss
	- `pop rax`

The stack has a `Last-in First-out` (`LIFO`) design, which means we can only `pop` out the last element `push`ed into the stack.


## Usage With Functions/Syscalls

We will primarily be pushing data from registers into the stack before we call a `function` or call a `syscall`, and then restore them after the function and the syscall. This is because `functions` and `syscalls` usually use the registers for their processing, and so if the values stored in the registers will get changed after a function call or a syscall, we will lose them.

For example, if we wanted to call a syscall to print `Hello World` to the screen and retain the current value stored in `rax`, we would `push rax` into the stack. Then we can execute the syscall and afterward `pop` the value back to `rax`. So, this way, we would be able to both execute the syscall and retain the value of `rax`.


## PUSH/POP

Our code currently looks like the following:
```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    xor rax, rax    ; initialize rax to 0
    xor rbx, rbx    ; initialize rbx to 0
    inc rbx         ; increment rbx to 1
loopFib:
    add rax, rbx    ; get the next number
    xchg rax, rbx   ; swap values
    cmp rbx, 10		; do rbx - 10
    js loopFib		; jump if result is <0
```

Let's assume that we want to call a `function` or a `syscall` before entering the loop. To preserve our registers, we will need to `push` to the stack all of the registers we are using and then pop them back after the `syscall`.

To `push` value into the stack, we can use its name as the operand, as in `push rax`, and the value will be `copied` to the top of the stack. When we want to retrieve that value, we first need to be sure that it is on the top of the stack, and then we can specify the storage location as the operand, as in `pop rax`, after which the value will be `moved` to `rax`, and will be `removed` from the top of the stack. The value below it will now be on top of the stack (as shown in the excise above).

>Since the stack has a **LIFO** design, when we restore our registers, we have to do them in **reverse order**. For example, if we **push rax** and then **push rbx**, when we restore, we have to **pop rbx** and then **pop rax**.

So, to save our registers before entering the loop, let's push them to the register. Luckily, we are only using `rax` and `rbx`, and so we will only need to `push` these two registers to the stack and then `pop` them after the syscall, as follows:
```nasm
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    xor rax, rax    ; initialize rax to 0
    xor rbx, rbx    ; initialize rbx to 0
    inc rbx         ; increment rbx to 1
    push rax        ; push registers to stack
    push rbx
    ; call function
    pop rbx         ; restore registers from stack
    pop rax
...SNIP...
```

Now, let's assemble our code and test it with `gdb`:
![[Pasted image 20230711205345.png]]

We see that before we execute `push rax`, we have `rax = 0x0` and `rbx = 0x1`. Now let's `push` both `rax` and `rbx`, and see how the stack and the registers change:
![[Pasted image 20230711205404.png]]

We see that after we `push`ed both `rax` and `rbx`, we have the following values on the top of our stack:
![[Pasted image 20230711205451.png|500]]

We see that at the top of the stack, we have the last value we pushed, which is `rbx = 0x1`, and just below it, we have the value we pushed before it `rax = 0x0`. This is as we expected and similar to the stack exercise above. We also notice that after we pushed our values, they remained in the registers, `meaning a push is, in fact, a copy to stack`.

Now let's assume that we finished executing a `print` function, and want to retrieve our values back, so we continue with the `pop` instructions:
![[Pasted image 20230711205545.png]]

We see that after `pop`ing two values from the top of the stack, they were removed from the stack, and the stack now looks exactly as when we first started. Both values were placed back in `rbx` and `rax`. We may not have seen any difference since they were not changed in the registers in this case.

Using the stack is very simple. The only thing we should keep in mind is the order we push our registers and the state of the stack to safely restore our data and not restore a different value by `pop` when a different value is at the top of the stack.

We can remove the `push` and `pop` instructions from our code for now, and we will use them when we get into function calls.
