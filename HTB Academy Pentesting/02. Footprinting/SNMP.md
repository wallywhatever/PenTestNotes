- Monitors network devices
- Can be used for remote configuration
- Transmits over UDP 161
- Traps are sent over UDP 162

- **MIB**
	- Management Information Base - format for storing device information
	- A text file of all queryable SNMP objects of a device written in ASN.1
	- Contains at least one OID

- **OID**
	- Object Identifier (OID)
	- A sequence of numbers that represents a node in hierarchial namespace.
	- We can look up many MIBs for the associated OIDs in theÂ [Object Identifier Registry](https://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/).

- **SNMPv1**
	- Used for network management and monitoring.
	- No built in authentication / does not support encryption

- **SNMPv2c**
	- Security wise is similiar to v1
	- The community string that provides security is transmitted in the clear.
	- Many orgs still use because v3 is much more complex

- **SNMPv3**
	- Added authentication and encryption via PSK.
	- Much more complex than v2c
