### Three Principles
1. There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.
2. Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.
3. There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.

### Enumeration Methodology
Layer | Description | Information Categories
------|-------------|------------------------------------------
1\. Internet Presence | Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure. | Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures
2\. Gateway | Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure. | Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare
3\. Accessible Services | Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally. | Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface
4\. Processes | Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services. | PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination
5\. Privileges | Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services. | Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment
6\. OS Setup | Identification of the internal components and systems setup. | OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files

**Layer 1: Internet Presence**
- The goal is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces.

**Layer 2: Gateway**
- The goal is to understand the interface of the target, how it is protected and where it is located.

**Layer 3: Accessible Services**
- This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it effectively.

**Layer 4: Processes**
- Whenever a command or function is executed, data is processed. 
- This starts a process that has to perform specific tasks that have at least one source and one target.
- The goal is to understand these and identify the dependencies between them.

**Layer 5: Privileges**
- Each service runs through a specific user in a group with permissions and privileges defined by the admin or system.
- These privileges often provide us with overlooked functions. This often happens in Active Directory infrastructures.

**Layer 6: OS Setup**
- We collect information about the actual operating system using internal access.
- This gives us an overview of internal security and reflects the skills and abilities of the admin team.
- The goal is to see how the administrators manage the system and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them.
