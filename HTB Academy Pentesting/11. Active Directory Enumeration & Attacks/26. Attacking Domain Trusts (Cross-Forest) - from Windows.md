## Cross-Forest Kerberoasting
-  In a situation where you are positioned in a domain with either an inbound or bidirectional domain/forest trust, you can likely perform various attacks to gain a foothold. 
	- Sometimes you cannot escalate privileges in your current domain, but instead can obtain a Kerberos ticket and crack a hash for an administrative user in another domain that has Domain/Enterprise Admin privileges in both domains.

#### Enumerating Accounts for Associated SPNs Using Get-DomainUser (PowerView)
``` powershell
Get-DomainUser -SPN -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL | select SamAccountName
```
![[2023-04-26 15_21_54-Hack The Box - Academy.png|600]]
- We see that there is one account with an SPN in the target domain. 

#### Enumerating the mssqlsvc Account
``` powershell
Get-DomainUser -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -Identity mssqlsvc | select samaccountname,memberof
```
![[2023-04-26 15_23_15-Hack The Box - Academy.png|600]]

- A quick check shows that this account is a member of the Domain Admins group in the target domain, so if we can Kerberoast it and crack the hash offline, we'd have full admin rights to the target domain.

#### Performing a Kerberoasting Attacking with Rubeus Using /domain Flag
``` powershell
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /domain:FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL /user:mssqlsvc /nowrap
```
- We run the tool the same as in the [[14. Kerberoasting - from Windows|Kerberoasting]] section but include the `/domain:` flag and specify the target domain.
- We could then run the hash through Hashcat. If it cracks, we've now quickly expanded our access to fully control two domains by leveraging a pretty standard attack and abusing the authentication direction and setup of the bidirectional forest trust.

## Admin Password Re-Use & Group Membership

- If we can take over Domain A and obtain cleartext passwords or NT hashes for either the built-in Administrator account or an account that is part of the Enterprise Admins or Domain Admins group in Domain A and Domain B has a highly privileged account with the same name. 
	- It is worth checking for password reuse across the two forests in this situation. 
	- I occasionally ran into issues where, for example, Domain A would have a user named `adm_bob.smith` in the Domain Admins group, and Domain B had a user named `bsmith_admin`. Sometimes, the user would be using the same password in the two domains, and owning Domain A instantly gave me full admin rights to Domain B.

- We may also see users or admins from Domain A as members of a group in Domain B. 
	- Only `Domain Local Groups` allow security principals from outside its forest. 
-  We may see a Domain Admin or Enterprise Admin from Domain A as a member of the built-in Administrators group in Domain B in a bidirectional forest trust relationship. 
	- If we can take over this admin user in Domain A, we would gain full administrative access to Domain B based on group membership.

We can use the PowerView function [Get-DomainForeignGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainForeignGroupMember) to enumerate groups with users that do not belong to the domain, also known as `foreign group membership`.

#### Using Get-DomainForeignGroupMember (PowerView)
``` powershell
Get-DomainForeignGroupMember -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
```
![[2023-04-26 15_28_30-Hack The Box - Academy.png|600]]
- The above command output shows that the built-in Administrators group in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` has the built-in Administrator account for the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain as a member. 
	- We can verify this access using the `Enter-PSSession` cmdlet to connect over WinRM.
	- 
#### Accessing DC03 Using Enter-PSSession
``` powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\administrator
```
![[2023-04-26 15_29_44-Hack The Box - Academy.png|700]]
- From the command output above, we can see that we successfully authenticated to the Domain Controller in the `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` domain using the Administrator account from the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain across the bidirectional forest trust.
	- This can be a quick win after taking control of a domain and is always worth checking for if a bidirectional forest trust situation is present during an assessment and the second forest is in-scope.

## SID History Abuse - Cross Forest
 - If a user is migrated from one forest to another and SID Filtering is not enabled, it becomes possible to add a SID from the other forest, and this SID will be added to the user's token when authenticating across the trust. 
 - If the SID of an account with administrative privileges in Forest A is added to the SID history attribute of an account in Forest B, assuming they can authenticate across the forest, then this account will have administrative privileges when accessing resources in the partner forest.

  - In the below diagram, we can see an example of the `jjones` user being migrated from the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain to the `CORP.LOCAL` domain in a different forest. 
  - If SID filtering is not enabled when this migration is made and the user has administrative privileges (or any type of interesting rights such as ACE entries, access to shares, etc.) in the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain, then they will retain their administrative rights/access in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` while being a member of the new domain, `CORP.LOCAL` in the second forest.
