## Creating an AD Snapshot with Active Directory Explorer

[AD Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer) is part of the Sysinternal Suite and is described as:

"An advanced Active Directory (AD) viewer and editor. You can use AD Explorer to navigate an AD database easily, define favorite locations, view object properties, and attributes without opening dialog boxes, edit permissions, view an object's schema, and execute sophisticated searches that you can save and re-execute."

AD Explorer can also be used to save snapshots of an AD database for offline viewing and comparison. We can take a snapshot of AD at a point in time and explore it later, during the reporting phase, as you would explore any other database. It can also be used to perform a before and after comparison of AD to uncover changes in objects, attributes, and security permissions.

When we first load the tool, we are prompted for login credentials or to load a previous snapshot. We can log in with any valid domain user.

To take a snapshot of AD, go to File --> `Create Snapshot` and enter a name for the snapshot. Once it is complete, we can move it offline for further analysis.

## PingCastle

- [PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/documentation/) is a powerful tool that evaluates the security posture of an AD environment and provides us the results in several different maps and graphs. 
	- Thinking about security for a second, if you do not have an active inventory of the hosts in your enterprise, PingCastle can be a great resource to help you gather one in a nice user-readable map of the domain. 
- PingCastle is different from tools such as PowerView and BloodHound because, aside from providing us with enumeration data that can inform our attacks, it also provides a detailed report of the target domain's security level using a methodology based on a risk assessment/maturity framework. The scoring shown in the report is based on the [Capability Maturity Model Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration) (CMMI). 
- For a quick look at the help context provided, you can issue the `--help` switch in cmd-prompt.

#### Viewing the PingCastle Help Menu

#### Running PingCastle

To run PingCastle, we can call the executable by typing `PingCastle.exe` into our CMD or PowerShell window or by clicking on the executable, and it will drop us into interactive mode, presenting us with a menu of options inside the `Terminal User Interface` (`TUI`).

#### PingCastle Interactive TUI
![[2023-04-27 15_16_47-Hack The Box - Academy.png|700]]

- The default option is the `healthcheck` run, which will establish a baseline overview of the domain, and provide us with pertinent information dealing with misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. 
- Even better, PingCastle can report recent vulnerability susceptibility, our shares, trusts, the delegation of permissions, and much more about our user and computer states. Under the Scanner option, we can find most of these checks.

#### Scanner Options

Now that we understand how it works and how to start scans, let's view the report.

#### Viewing The Report

Throughout the report, there are sections such as domain, user, group, and trust information and a specific table calling out "anomalies" or issues that may require immediate attention. We will also be presented with the domain's overall risk score.

Aside from being helpful in performing very thorough domain enumeration when combined with other tools, PingCastle can be helpful to give clients a quick analysis of their domain security posture, or can be used by internal teams to self-assess and find areas of concern or opportunities for further hardening.

## Group3r

[Group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r) is a tool purpose-built to find vulnerabilities in Active Directory associated Group Policy. Group3r must be run from a domain-joined host with a domain user (it does not need to be an administrator), or in the context of a domain user (i.e., using `runas /netonly`).

With group policy being a large portion of how AD user and computer management is done, it's only logical that we would want to audit their settings and highlight any potential holes. `Group3r` is an excellent tool for this.

#### Group3r Basic Usage
``` cmd.exe
group3r.exe -f <filepath-name.log>
```
- When running Group3r, we must specify the `-s` or the `-f` flag. 
	- These will specify whether to send results to stdout (`-s`), or to the file we want to send the results to (`-f`). For more options and usage information, utilize the `-h` flag, or check out the usage info at the link above.

Below is an example of starting Group3r.

#### Reading Output
![[Pasted image 20230427152044.png|700]]
When reading the output from Group3r, each indentation is a different level, so no indent will be the GPO, one indent will be policy settings, and another will be findings in those settings. Below we will take a look at the output shown from a finding.

#### Group3r Finding
![[Pasted image 20230427152109.png|700]]
In the image above, you will see an example of a finding from Group3r. It will present it as a linked box to the policy setting, define the interesting portion and give us a reason for the finding. It is worth the effort to run Group3r if you have the opportunity. It will often find interesting paths or objects that other tools will overlook.

## ADRecon

Finally, there are several other tools out there that are useful for gathering a large amount of data from AD at once. In an assessment where stealth is not required, it is also worth running a tool like [ADRecon](https://github.com/adrecon/ADRecon) and analyzing the results, just in case all of our enumeration missed something minor that may be useful to us or worth pointing out to our client.

#### Running ADRecon
![[2023-04-27 15_22_24-Hack The Box - Academy.png|600]]
- Once done, ADRecon will drop a report for us in a new folder under the directory we executed from. 
	- We can see an example of the results in the terminal below. 
- You will get a report in HTML format and a folder with CSV results. 
	- When generating the report, it should be noted that the program Excel needs to be installed, or the script will not automatically generate the report in that manner; it will just leave you with the .csv files. 
	- If you want output for Group Policy, you need to ensure the host you run from has the `GroupPolicy` PowerShell module installed. We can go back later and generate the Excel report from another host using the `-GenExcel` switch and feeding in the report folder.
