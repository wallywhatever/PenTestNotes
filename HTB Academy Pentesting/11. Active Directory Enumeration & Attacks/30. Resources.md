## More AD Learning Opportunities

The Hack The Box main platform has many targets for learning and practicing AD enumeration and attacks. The [AD Track](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/tracks/4) on the main HTB platform is an excellent resource for practice. `Tracks` are curated lists of machines and challenges for users to work through and master a particular topic. The AD Track contains boxes of varying difficulties with various attack vectors. Even if you cannot solve these boxes on your own, it is still worth working with them with a walkthrough or video or just watching the video on the box by Ippsec. The more you expose yourself to these topics, the more comfortable and second nature enumeration and many attacks will become. The boxes below are great to practice the skills learned in this module.

#### Great Videos to Check Out

[Six Degrees of Domain Admin](https://youtu.be/wP8ZCczC1OU) from `DEFCON 24` is a great watch for an introduction to BloodHound.  
[Designing AD DACL Backdoors](https://youtu.be/_nGpZ1ydzS8) by Will Schroeder and Andy Robbins is a gem if you haven't seen it.[Kicking The Guard Dog of Hades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUyhlN-E5MU) is one of the original releases for Kerberoasting and is a great watch. In [Kerberoasting 101](https://youtu.be/Jaa2LmZaNeU), Tim Medin does an excellent job dissecting the Kerberoasting attack and how to perform them.

There are so many more, but building a list here would take a whole other section. The videos above are a great start to advancing your AD knowledge.

#### Writers and Blogs To Follow

Between the HTB `Discord`, Forums, and `blogs`, there are plenty of outstanding write-ups to help advance your skills along the way. One to pay attention to would be [0xdf's walkthroughs](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/tags.html#active-directory). These are also a great resource to understand how an Active Directory `attack path` may look in the real world. `0xdf` writes about much more, and his blog is an excellent resource. The list below contains links to other authors and blogs we feel do a great job discussing AD security topics and much more.

[SpecterOps](https://posts.specterops.io/) has an interesting blog where they talk about AD, `BloodHound`, Command and Control, and so much more.  
[Harmj0y](https://blog.harmj0y.net/category/activedirectory/) writes quite a bit about AD, among other things as well. He is someone you should be following if you are looking to work in this industry.  
[AD Security Blog](https://adsecurity.org/?author=2) by Sean Metcalf is a treasure box full of awesome content, all AD and security related. It is a must-read if you are focused on Active Directory.  
[Shenaniganslabs](https://shenaniganslabs.io/) is a great group of security researchers discussing many different topics in the security realm. These can include new vulnerabilities to Threat Actor TTPs.  
[Dirk-jan Mollema](https://dirkjanm.io/) also has a great blog documenting his adventures with AD security, Azure, protocols, vulnerabilities, Python, etc.  
[The DFIR Report](https://thedfirreport.com/) is maintained by a talented team of Blue Teamers/Infosec Content creators that share their findings from recent intrusion incidents in incredible detail. Many of their posts showcase AD attacks and the artifacts that attackers leave behind.
