## Exchange Related Group Membership

- A default Exchange install in an AD environment (with no split-admin model) opens many attack vectors.
- The group **Exchange Windows Permissions** is not listed as a protected gorup but members are granted the ability to write a DACL to the domain object.
	- This can be leveraged for DCSync privileges.
	- An attacker can add accounts to his group by leveraging a DACL misconfig (possible) or using a compromised account thats a member of the Account Operators group.
- 
- The Exchange group `Organization Management` is another extremely powerful group (effectively the "Domain Admins" of Exchange) and can access the mailboxes of all domain users. It is not uncommon for sysadmins to be members of this group. 
	- This group also has full control of the OU called `Microsoft Exchange Security Groups`, which contains the group `Exchange Windows Permissions`.

- If we can compromise an Exchange server, this will often lead to Domain Admin privileges. Additionally, dumping credentials in memory from an Exchange server will produce 10s if not 100s of cleartext credentials or NTLM hashes.
	- This is often due to users logging in to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange caching their credentials in memory after a successful login.

- This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gdedrouas/Exchange-AD-Privesc) details a few techniques for leveraging Exchange for escalating privileges in an AD environment.
___

## PrivExchange

- The `PrivExchange` attack results from a flaw in the Exchange Server `PushSubscription` feature, which allows any domain user with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over HTTP.
	- The Exchange services runs as SYSTEM and is over privileged by default. This can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and dump the domain NTDS database.
		- If we cannot relay to LDAP, this can be leveraged to relay and authenticate to other hosts within the domain. This attack will take you directly to Domain Admin with any authenticated domain user account.
___

## Printer Bug

- Printer Bug is a flag in the MS-RPRN protocol (Print System Remote Protocol).
	- This protocol defines the communication of print job processing and print system client-server management.
- To leverage this flaw, any domain user can connect to the spool's named pipe with the **RpcOpenPrinter** method and use the **RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx** method and force the server to auth to any host provided by the client over SMB.

- The spooler server runs as SYSTEM and is installed by default in Windows Servers running Desktop Experience.
	-  This attack can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and grant your attacker account DCSync privileges to retrieve all password hashes from AD.

The attack can also be used to relay LDAP authentication and grant Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) privileges for the victim to a computer account under our control, thus giving the attacker privileges to authenticate as any user on the victim's computer. This attack can be leveraged to compromise a Domain Controller in a partner domain/forest, provided you have administrative access to a Domain Controller in the first forest/domain already, and the trust allows TGT delegation, which is not by default anymore.

- We can use tools such as the `Get-SpoolStatus` module from [this](https://github.com/cube0x0/Security-Assessment) tool to check for machines vulnerable to the [MS-PRN Printer Bug](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/mitm-and-coerced-authentications/ms-rprn). 
	- This flaw can be used to compromise a host in another forest that has Unconstrained Delegation enabled, such as a domain controller. 
	- It can help us to attack across forest trusts once we have compromised one forest.

#### Enumerating for MS-PRN Printer Bug
``` powershell
Import-Module .\SecurityAssessment.ps1

Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```
___

## MS14-068

- This was a flaw in the Kerberos protocol, which could be leveraged along with standard domain user credentials to elevate privileges to Domain Admin. 
	- A Kerberos ticket contains information about a user, including the account name, ID, and group membership in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC). 
		- The PAC is signed by the KDC using secret keys to validate that the PAC has not been tampered with after creation.
- The vulnerability allowed a forged PAC to be accepted by the KDC as legitimate. This can be leveraged to create a fake PAC, presenting a user as a member of the Domain Administrators or other privileged group. 
	- It can be exploited with tools such as the [Python Kerberos Exploitation Kit (PyKEK)](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS14-068/pykek) or the Impacket toolkit. The only defense against this attack is patching. 
		- The machine [Mantis](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/98) on the Hack The Box platform showcases this vulnerability.
___

## Sniffing LDAP Credentials

- Many applications and printers store LDAP creds in their web admin console to connect to the domain.
	- These consoles are often left with weak or default passwords. Sometimes, these credentials can be viewed in cleartext. 
	- Other times, the application has a `test connection` function that we can use to gather credentials by changing the LDAP IP address to that of our attack host and setting up a `netcat` listener on LDAP port 389. 
		- When the device attempts to test the LDAP connection, it will send the credentials to our machine, often in cleartext. Accounts used for LDAP connections are often privileged, but if not, this could serve as an initial foothold in the domain. 
		- Other times, a full LDAP server is required to pull off this attack, as detailed in this [post](https://grimhacker.com/2018/03/09/just-a-printer/).
___

## Enumering DNS Records

- We can use a tool such as [adidnsdump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump) to enumerate all DNS records in a domain using a valid domain user account. 
	- This is especially helpful if the naming convention for hosts returned to us in our enumeration using tools such as `BloodHound` is similar to `SRV01934.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. 
	- If all servers and workstations have a non-descriptive name, it makes it difficult for us to know what exactly to attack. 
		- If we can access DNS entries in AD, we can potentially discover interesting DNS records that point to this same server, such as `JENKINS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, which we can use to better plan out our attacks.

- The tool works because, by default, all users can list the child objects of a DNS zone in an AD environment. 
- By default, querying DNS records using LDAP does not return all results. 
	- So by using the `adidnsdump` tool, we can resolve all records in the zone and potentially find something useful for our engagement. 
	- The background and more in-depth explanation of this tool and technique can be found in this [post](https://dirkjanm.io/getting-in-the-zone-dumping-active-directory-dns-with-adidnsdump/).

#### Using adidnsdump
``` bash
adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 
```
![[2023-04-25 12_17_10-Hack The Box - Academy.png|400]]
![[2023-04-25 12_17_21-Hack The Box - Academy.png|400]]
- On the first run we see that some records or blank, namely `?,LOGISTICS,?`

#### Using the -r Option to Resolve Unknown Records
``` bash
 adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r
```
- The `-r` flag attempts to resolve unknown records by performing an `A` query.
- Its worth running this tool in larger environments because we may uncover "hidden" records that can lead to discovering interesting hosts.
___

# Other Misconfigurations

## Password in Description Field
- Sensitive information such as account passwords are sometimes found in the user account `Description` or `Notes` fields and can be quickly enumerated using PowerView. 
- For large domains, it is helpful to export this data to a CSV file to review offline.

#### Finding Passwords in the Description Field using Get-Domain User (PowerView)
``` powershell
Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}
```
___

## PASSWD_NOTREQD Field

- It is possible to come across domain accounts with the [passwd_notreqd](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/PASSWD_NOTREQD) field set in the userAccountControl attribute. 
	- If this is set, the user is not subject to the current password policy length, meaning they could have a shorter password or no password at all (if empty passwords are allowed in the domain). 
	- A password may be set as blank intentionally (sometimes admins don’t want to be called out of hours to reset user passwords) or accidentally hitting enter before entering a password when changing it via the command line.
- Just because this flag is set on an account, it doesn't mean that no password is set, just that one may not be required. 
	- There are many reasons why this flag may be set on a user account, one being that a vendor product set this flag on certain accounts at the time of installation and never removed the flag post-install. 
- It is worth enumerating accounts with this flag set and testing each to see if no password is required (I have seen this a couple of times on assessments). 
	- Also, include it in the client report if the goal of the assessment is to be as comprehensive as possible.

#### Checking for PASSWD_NOTREQD Setting using Get-DomainUser (PowerView)
``` powershell
Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```
___

## Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts

- The SYSVOL share can be a treasure trove of data, especially in large organizations. 
	- We may find many different batch, VBScript, and PowerShell scripts within the scripts directory, which is readable by all authenticated users in the domain. 
	- It is worth digging around this directory to hunt for passwords stored in scripts. Sometimes we will find very old scripts containing since disabled accounts or old passwords, but from time to time, we will strike gold, so we should always dig through this directory. 
- Here, we can see an interesting script named `reset_local_admin_pass.vbs`.
![[2023-04-25 12_23_57-Hack The Box - Academy.png|500]]
- Taking a closer look at the script, we see that it contains a password for the built-in local administrator on Windows hosts. 
	- In this case, it would be worth checking to see if this password is still set on any hosts in the domain. 
	- We could do this using CrackMapExec and the `--local-auth` flag as shown in this module's [[07. Internal Password Spraying - from Linux|Internal Password Spraying from Linux]] section.
___

## Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords

When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:

-   Map drives (drives.xml)
-   Create local users
-   Create printer config files (printers.xml)
-   Creating and updating services (services.xml)
-   Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
-   Changing local admin passwords.

- These files can contain an array of configuration data and defined passwords. 
- The `cpassword` attribute value is AES-256 bit encrypted, but Microsoft [published the AES private key on MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN), which can be used to decrypt the password. 
	- Any domain user can read these files as they are stored on the SYSVOL share, and all authenticated users in a domain, by default, have read access to this domain controller share.

- This was patched in 2014 [MS14-025 Vulnerability in GPP could allow elevation of privilege](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms14-025-vulnerability-in-group-policy-preferences-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-may-13-2014-60734e15-af79-26ca-ea53-8cd617073c30), to prevent administrators from setting passwords using GPP. 
	- The patch does not remove existing Groups.xml files with passwords from SYSVOL. 
	- If you delete the GPP policy instead of unlinking it from the OU, the cached copy on the local computer remains.

The XML looks like the following:
![[Pasted image 20230425122729.png]]

If you retrieve the cpassword value manually, gpp-decrypt can be used to decrypt the password
``` bash
gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE
```

- GPP passwords can be located by searching or manually browsing the SYSVOL share or using tools such as 
	- [Get-GPPPassword.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPPassword.ps1), 
	- the GPP Metasploit Post Module, 
	- and other Python/Ruby scripts which will locate the GPP and return the decrypted cpassword value. 
	- CrackMapExec also has two modules for locating and retrieving GPP passwords. 

- One quick tip to consider during engagements: Often, GPP passwords are defined for legacy accounts, and you may therefore retrieve and decrypt the password for a locked or deleted account. 
	- However, it is worth attempting to password spray internally with this password (especially if it is unique). Password re-use is widespread, and the GPP password combined with password spraying could result in further access.

#### Locating & Retrieving GPP Passwords with CrackMapExec
``` bash
crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp
```

- It is also possible to find passwords in files such as Registry.xml when **autologon** is configured via Group Policy.
-  If this is set via Group Policy and not locally on the host, then anyone on the domain can retrieve credentials stored in the Registry.xml file created for this purpose.
	- This is a separate issue from GPP passwords as Microsoft has not taken any action to block storing these credentials on the SYSVOL in cleartext and, hence, are readable by any authenticated user in the domain. 
- We can hunt for this using CrackMapExec with the [gpp_autologin](https://www.infosecmatter.com/crackmapexec-module-library/?cmem=smb-gpp_autologin) module, or using the [Get-GPPAutologon.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPAutologon.ps1) script included in PowerSploit.

#### Using CrackMapExec's gpp_autologin Module
``` bash
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M gpp_autologin
```
___

## ASREPRoasting

- It's possible to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any account that has the [Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication](https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-to-stop-the-kerberos-pre-authentication-attack-in-active-directory) setting enabled. Many vendor installation guides specify that their service account be configured in this way. 
	- The authentication service reply (AS_REP) is encrypted with the account’s password, and any domain user can request it.
- With pre-authentication, a user enters their password, which encrypts a time stamp. 
	- The Domain Controller will decrypt this to validate that the correct password was used.
		- If successful, a TGT will be issued to the user for further authentication requests in the domain. 
- If an account has pre-authentication disabled, an attacker can request authentication data for the affected account and retrieve an encrypted TGT from the Domain Controller. 
	- This can be subjected to an offline password attack using a tool such as Hashcat or John the Ripper.
- ASREPRoasting is similar to Kerberoasting, but it involves attacking the AS-REP instead of the TGS-REP. An SPN is not required.
	- This can be enumerated with PowerView.
- The attack itself can be performed with the [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) toolkit and other tools to obtain the ticket for the target account. 
	- If an attacker has `GenericWrite` or `GenericAll` permissions over an account, they can enable this attribute and obtain the AS-REP ticket for offline cracking to recover the account's password before disabling the attribute again. 
	- Like Kerberoasting, the success of this attack depends on the account having a relatively weak password.

#### Enumerating for DONT_REQ_PREAUTH Value using Get-DomainUser (PowerView)
``` powershell
Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | select samaccountname,userprincipalname,useraccountcontrol | fl
```
- With this information, Rubeus can be used to retrieve the AS-REP in the proper format for offline hash cracking.
	-  This attack does not require any domain user context and can be done by just knowing the SAM name for the user without Kerberos pre-auth.

#### Retrieving AS-REP in Proper Format using Rubeus
``` powershell
.\Rubeus.exe asreproast /user:mmorgan /nowrap /format:hashcat
```
![[2023-04-25 18_13_20-Hack The Box - Academy.png|600]]
- We can then crack the hash offline with **Hashcat mode 18200**

- We can also use Kerbrute to enumerate users
	- Kerbrute will automatically retrieve the AS-REP for any users that do not require Kerberos pre-auth

#### Retrieving the AS-REP Using Kerbrute
``` bash
kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt 
```
![[2023-04-25 18_19_04-Hack The Box - Academy.png|600]]

#### Hunting for Users with Kerberoast Pre-auth Not Required (Impacket)
``` bash
GetNPUsers.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -no-pass -usersfile valid_ad_users 
```
- If we have a list of valid users, we can use `Get-NPUsers.py` to hunt for users with Kerberoast pre-auth not requires
	- If we don't have a list of valid users, we can use a wordlist like `jsmith.txt`. Impacket will throw errors but will still return AS-REP hashes.
	- The tool will retrieve the AS-REP in Hashcat format for offline cracking for any found.

## Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse
-  If we can gain rights over a Group Policy Object via an ACL misconfiguration, we could leverage this for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and even domain compromise and as a persistence mechanism within the domain.

GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:
-   Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
-   Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
-   Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions

- We can enumerate GPO infromation using Powerview or Bloodhound
	- We can also use [group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r), [ADRecon](https://github.com/sense-of-security/ADRecon), [PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/), etc...

#### Enumerating GPO Names with PowerView
``` powershell
 Get-DomainGPO |select displayname
```
- This can be helpful for us to begin to see what types of security measures are in place (such as denying cmd.exe access and a separate password policy for service accounts).
	- For example: if we see that autologon is in use it may mean there is a readable password in a GPO, or see that Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is present in the domain.

#### Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet
``` powershell
Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName
```
- Works if Group Policy Management Tools are installed on the host we're working from.

- We want to check which users have rights over a GPO.
	- A good place to start is with the Domain Users group

#### Enumerating Domain User GPO Rights
``` powershell
$sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"

Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```
![[2023-04-25 18_28_32-Hack The Box - Academy.png|600]]
- Here we see that Domain Users groups has some permissions over a GPO like, `WriteProperty` and `WriteDacl` which we could leverage to get full control over the GPO and use attacks that would be pushed down to the users and computers in the OUs the GPO applies to.

#### Converting GPO GUID to Name
``` powershell
Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532
```
- This will resolve the GUID to the display name.

- We could use a tool such as [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse) to take advantage of this GPO misconfiguration by performing actions such as adding a user that we control to the local admins group on one of the affected hosts, creating an immediate scheduled task on one of the hosts to give us a reverse shell, or configure a malicious computer startup script to provide us with a reverse shell or similar.
- 
>When using a tool like this, we need to be careful because commands can be run that affect every computer within the OU that the GPO is linked to. If we found an editable GPO that applies to an OU with 1,000 computers, we would not want to make the mistake of adding ourselves as a local admin to that many hosts
