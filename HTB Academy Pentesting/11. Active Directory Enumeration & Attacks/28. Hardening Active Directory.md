## Step One: Document and Audit

Proper AD hardening can keep attackers contained and prevent lateral movement, privilege escalation, and access to sensitive data and resources. One of the essential steps in AD hardening is understanding everything present in your AD environment. An audit of everything listed below should be done annually, if not every few months, to ensure your records are up to date. We care about:

#### Things To Document and Track

-   `Naming conventions of OUs, computers, users, groups`
-   `DNS, network, and DHCP configurations`
-   `An intimate understanding of all GPOs and the objects that they are applied to`
-   `Assignment of FSMO roles`
-   `Full and current application inventory`
-   `A list of all enterprise hosts and their location`
-   `Any trust relationships we have with other domains or outside entities`
-   `Users who have elevated permissions`

## People, Processes, and Technology

AD hardening can be broken out into the categories _People_, _Process,_ and _Technology_. These hardening measures will encompass the hardware, software, and human aspects of any network.

### People

In even the most hardened environment, users remain the weakest link. Enforcing security best practices for standard users and administrators will prevent "easy wins" for pentesters and malicious attackers. We should also strive to keep our users educated and aware of threats to themselves. The measures below are a great way to start securing the Human element of an AD environment.

-   The organization should have a strong password policy, with a password filter that disallows the use of common words (i.e., welcome, password, names of months/days/seasons, and the company name). If possible, an enterprise password manager should be used to assist users with choosing and using complex passwords.
-   Rotate passwords periodically for **all** service accounts.
-   Disallow local administrator access on user workstations unless a specific business need exists.
-   Disable the default `RID-500 local admin` account and create a new admin account for administration subject to LAPS password rotation.
-   Implement split tiers of administration for administrative users. Too often, during an assessment, you will gain access to Domain Administrator credentials on a computer that an administrator uses for all work activities.
-   Clean up privileged groups. `Does the organization need 50+ Domain/Enterprise Admins?` Restrict group membership in highly privileged groups to only those users who require this access to perform their day-to-day system administrator duties.
-   Where appropriate, place accounts in the `Protected Users` group.
-   Disable Kerberos delegation for administrative accounts (the Protected Users group may not do this)


### Protected Users Group

The [Protected Users group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/protected-users-security-group) first appeared with Window Server 2012 R2. This group can be used to restrict what members of this privileged group can do in a domain. Adding users to Protected Users prevents user credentials from being abused if left in memory on a host.

#### Viewing the Protected Users Group with Get-ADGroup
``` powershell
Get-ADGroup -Identity "Protected Users" -Properties Name,Description,Members
```

The group provides the following Domain Controller and device protections:

-   Group members can not be delegated with constrained or unconstrained delegation.
-   CredSSP will not cache plaintext credentials in memory even if Allow delegating default credentials is set within Group Policy.
-   Windows Digest will not cache the user's plaintext password, even if Windows Digest is enabled.
-   Members cannot authenticate using NTLM authentication or use DES or RC4 keys.
-   After acquiring a TGT, the user's long-term keys or plaintext credentials are not cached.
-   Members cannot renew a TGT longer than the original 4-hour TTL.

> Note: The Protected Users group can cause unforeseen issues with authentication, which can easily result in account lockouts. An organization should never place all privileged users in this group without staged testing.

### Processes

Maintaining and enforcing policies and procedures that can significantly impact an organization's overall security posture is necessary. Without defined policies, it is impossible to hold an organization's employees accountable, and difficult to respond to an incident without defined and practiced procedures such as a disaster recovery plan. The items below can help to define processes, policies, and procedures.

-   Proper policies and procedures for AD asset management.
    -   AD host audit, the use of asset tags, and periodic asset inventories can help ensure hosts are not lost.
-   Access control policies (user account provisioning/de-provisioning), multi-factor authentication mechanisms.
-   Processes for provisioning and decommissioning hosts (i.e., baseline security hardening guideline, gold images)
-   AD cleanup policies
    -   `Are accounts for former employees removed or just disabled?`
    -   `What is the process for removing stale records from AD?`
    -   Processes for decommissioning legacy operating systems/services (i.e., proper uninstallation of Exchange when migrating to 0365).
    -   Schedule for User, groups, and hosts audit.

### Technology

Periodically review AD for legacy misconfigurations and new and emerging threats. As changes are made to AD, ensure that common misconfigurations are not introduced. Pay attention to any vulnerabilities introduced by AD and tools or applications utilized in the environment.

-   Run tools such as BloodHound, PingCastle, and Grouper periodically to identify AD misconfigurations.
-   Ensure that administrators are not storing passwords in the AD account description field.
-   Review SYSVOL for scripts containing passwords and other sensitive data.
-   Avoid the use of "normal" service accounts, utilizing Group Managed (gMSA) and Managed Service Accounts (MSA) where ever possible to mitigate the risk of Kerberoasting.
-   Disable Unconstrained Delegation wherever possible.
-   Prevent direct access to Domain Controllers through the use of hardened jump hosts.
-   Consider setting the `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` attribute to `0`, which disallows users from adding machine accounts and can prevent several attacks such as the noPac attack and Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)
-   Disable the print spooler service wherever possible to prevent several attacks
-   Disable NTLM authentication for Domain Controllers if possible
-   Use Extended Protection for Authentication along with enabling Require SSL only to allow HTTPS connections for the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services
-   Enable SMB signing and LDAP signing
-   Take steps to prevent enumeration with tools like BloodHound
-   Ideally, perform quarterly penetration tests/AD security assessments, but if budget constraints exist, these should be performed annually at the very least.
-   Test backups for validity and review/practice disaster recovery plans.
-   Enable the restriction of anonymous access and prevent null session enumeration by setting the `RestrictNullSessAccess` registry key to `1` to restrict null session access to unauthenticated users.

## Protections By Section

As a different look at this, we have broken out the significant actions by section and correlated controls based on the TTP and a MITRE tag. Each tag corresponds with a section of the [Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/) found here. Any tag marked as `TA` corresponds to an overarching tactic, while a tag marked as `T###` is a technique found in the matrix under tactics.

#### MITRE ATT&CK Breakdown
![[mitre.gif]]
I wanted to take a second to show everyone how it appears when exploring the ATT&CK framework. We will use the example above of `Kerberoasting` to look at it through the lens of the framework. Kerberoasting is a part of the larger `Tactic tag TA0006 Credential Access` (Green square in the image above). Tactics encompass the overall goal of the actor and will contain various techniques which map to that goal. Within this scope, you will see all manner of credential-stealing techniques. We can scroll down and look for `Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets`, which is `Technique Tag T1558` (blue square in the image above). This technique contains four sub-techniques (indicated by the `.00#` beside the technique name) Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket, Kerberoasting, and AS-REP Roasting. Since we care about Kerberoasting, we would select the sub-technique `T1558.003` (orange box in the image above), and it will take us to a new page. Here, we can see a general explanation of the technique, the information referencing the ATT&CK platform classification on the top right, examples of its use in the real world, ways to mitigate and detect the tactic, and finally, references for more information at the bottom of the page.

So our technique would be classified under `TA0006/T1558.003`. This is how the Tactic/Technique tree would be read. There are many different ways to navigate the framework. We just wanted to provide some clarification on what we were looking for and how we were defining tactics versus techniques when talking about MITRE ATT&CK in this module. This framework is great to explore if you are curious about a `Tactic` or `Technique` and want more information about it.

These are not an exhaustive list of defensive measures, but they are a strong start. As attackers, if we understand the potential defensive measures we can face during our assessments, we can plan for alternate means of exploitation and movement. We won't win every battle; some defenders may have their environments locked down tight and see every move you make, but others may have missed one of these recommendations. It is important to explore them all, and help provide the defensive team with the best results possible. Also, understanding how the attacks and defenses work will make us improve cybersecurity practitioners overall.
