All of the checks are explained [here](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation)|
|[PowerUp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1)|PowerShell script for finding common Windows privilege escalation vectors that rely on misconfigurations. It can also be used to exploit some of the issues found|
|[SharpUp](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp)|C# version of PowerUp|
|[JAWS](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS)|PowerShell script for enumerating privilege escalation vectors written in PowerShell 2.0|
|[SessionGopher](https://github.com/Arvanaghi/SessionGopher)|SessionGopher is a PowerShell tool that finds and decrypts saved session information for remote access tools. It extracts PuTTY, WinSCP, SuperPuTTY, FileZilla, and RDP saved session information|
|[Watson](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson)|Watson is a .NET tool designed to enumerate missing KBs and suggest exploits for Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities.|

|[Windows Exploit Suggester - Next Generation](https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng)|WES-NG is a tool based on the output of Windows' `systeminfo` utility which provides the list of vulnerabilities the OS is vulnerable to, including any exploits for these vulnerabilities. Every Windows OS between Windows XP and Windows 10, including their Windows Server counterparts, is supported|
|[Sysinternals Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite)|We will use several tools from Sysinternals in our enumeration including [AccessChk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk), [PipeList](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pipelist), and [PsService](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psservice)|

We can also find pre-compiled binaries of `Seatbelt` and `SharpUp` [here](https://github.com/r3motecontrol/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries), and standalone binaries of `LaZagne` [here](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/). It is recommended that we always compile our tools from the source if using them in a client environment.

>Note: Depending on how we gain access to a system we may not have many directories that are writeable by our user to upload tools. It is always a safe bet to upload tools to `C:\Windows\Temp` because the `BUILTIN\Users` group has write access.
