Windows 7 was made end-of-life on January 14, 2020, but is still in use in many environments.

#### Install Python Dependencies (local VM only)

This tool works on the Pwnbox, but to get it working on a local version of Parrot, we need to do the following to install the necessary dependencies.
```bash
sudo wget https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/28/84/27df240f3f8f52511965979aad7c7b77606f8fe41d4c90f2449e02172bb1/setuptools-2.0.tar.gz
sudo tar -xf setuptools-2.0.tar.gz
cd setuptools-2.0/
sudo python2.7 setup.py install

sudo wget https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/42/85/25caf967c2d496067489e0bb32df069a8361e1fd96a7e9f35408e56b3aab/xlrd-1.0.0.tar.gz
sudo tar -xf xlrd-1.0.0.tar.gz
cd xlrd-1.0.0/
sudo python2.7 setup.py install

git clone https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester.git
```

#### Gathering Systeminfo Command Output

Once this is done, we need to capture the `systeminfo` command's output and save it to a text file on our attack VM.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> systeminfo

#### Updating the Local Microsoft Vulnerability Database

We then need to update our local copy of the Microsoft Vulnerability database. This command will save the contents to a local Excel file.
```bash
sudo python2.7 windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
```

#### Running Windows Exploit Suggester

Once this is done, we can run the tool against the vulnerability database to check for potential privilege escalation flaws.
```bash
python2.7 windows-exploit-suggester.py  --database 2021-05-13-mssb.xls --systeminfo win7lpe-systeminfo.txt 
```

Suppose we have obtained a Meterpreter shell on our target using the Metasploit framework. In that case, we can also use this [local exploit suggester module](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/08/11/metasploit-local-exploit-suggester-do-less-get-more/) which will help us quickly find any potential privilege escalation vectors and run them within Metasploit should any module exist.

Looking through the results, we can see a rather extensive list, some Metasploit modules, and some standalone PoC exploits. We must filter through the noise, remove any Denial of Service exploits, and exploits that do not make sense for our target OS. One that stands out immediately as interesting is MS16-032. A detailed explanation of this bug can be found in this [Project Zero blog post](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/03/exploiting-leaked-thread-handle.html) which is a bug in the Secondary Logon Service.

#### Exploiting MS16-032 with PowerShell PoC

Let's use a [PowerShell PoC](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39719) to attempt to exploit this and elevate our privileges.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Set-ExecutionPolicy bypass -scope process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic. Do you want to change the execution
policy?

#### Spawning a SYSTEM Console

This works and we spawn a SYSTEM cmd console.
