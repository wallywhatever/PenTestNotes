- [Plink](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), short for PuTTY Link, is a Windows command-line SSH tool thats part of PuTTY.
- Plink can be used to create dynamic port forwards and SOCKS proxies.
	- Before 2018 Windows didn't have a native SSH client. PuTTY was a popular choice.
- Plink is useful for using a Windows host as a pivot.

#### Using Plink.exe
``` cmd.exe
plink -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.15.50
```
- This command starts a dynamic (`-D`) port forward and plink starts listening on port 9050

- [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) can be used to start a SOCKS tunnel via the SSH session we created.
	- It's possible to create a profile where we can provide the config for the Plink SOCKS server.

- Setting the server address to `127.0.0.1` and the port to `9050` we can start `mstsc.exe` to start an RDP session with a Windows target that allows RDP.
