- [Sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle)Â is another tool written in Python which removes the need to configure proxychains.
	- Only works for pivoting over SSH. Does not have options for TOR or HTTPS.
- Sshuttle is very usefule for automating the execution of iptables and adding picot rules for the remote host.

#### Install sshuttle
``` bash
sudo apt install sshuttle
```

#### Running sshuttle
``` bash
sudo sshuttle -r ubuntu@10.129.202.64 172.16.5.0/23 -v 
```
- We specify `-r` to connect to the remote host with a username and password.
- Then we include the network or IP we want to route through the pivot host. In this case its the network 172.16.5.0/23.
- This also creates an entry in iptables to redirect all traffic.
- This allows us to use all tools normally without proxychains.
