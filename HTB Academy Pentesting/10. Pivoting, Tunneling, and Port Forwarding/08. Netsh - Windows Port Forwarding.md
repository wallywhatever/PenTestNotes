- [Netsh](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-contexts) is a Windows command-line tool to help with network configuration.
- Netsh can be used for:
	- Finding routes
	- Viewing the firewall configuration
	- Adding proxies
	- Creating port foward rules

- In this scenario we have compromised the dual network Windows10 User host.

#### Using netsh.exe to port forward
``` cmd.exe
netsh.exe interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8080 listenaddress=10.129.15.150 connectport=3389 connectaddress=172.16.5.25
```
- This forwards all data recieved on port 8080 to the connect port at the connect address

#### Verify Port Forward
``` bash
netsh.exe interface portproxy show v4tov4
```

- This will then allow us to RDP from our Attack Host to the Windows Server target by connecting to port 8080 on the pivot host.
